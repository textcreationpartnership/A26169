            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But the Nation was glad to find their private Reſentments, and <hi>ſelf-Defence,</hi> to carry them along with the <hi>Publick Intereſt,</hi> which ſome of them had ſacrificed to low Ends, or ſtupidly neglected; being as unconcern'd at publick Calamities, as if their former Exemptions, which they ſeem'd to aim at, had made them of another diſtinct Community.</p>
                  <p>Such as theſe deſervedly loſt the Credit of their ſhare in this <hi>Revolution,</hi> not only as they had drawn their Sufferings upon themſelves, and others, by tempting thoſe whom they flattered to make Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the force of their Doctrine; but as their ſubſequent Carriage has demonſtrated, upon what narrow Principles they engag'd, not in the Cauſe of their Country, but their Own. Their lowneſs of Spirit makes them reſemble thoſe fawning Creatures, whom the leaſt Gentleneſs raiſes to Familiarity; but notwithſtanding the Advantages which they enjoy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Government, 'tis not to be preſum'd that they are given them otherwiſe, than to reclaim and wean them from Notions, as deſtructive, as they are uſeleſs, to this equal Adminiſtration.</p>

                  <p>As it is our Happineſs to have a King born, and acting for the Good of Mankind, it is not to be fear'd

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE following Collections, in which I may ſay I have taken ſome Pains, are but an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement upon what I publiſh'd, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Acceſſion of their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to the Throne of this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs ſay I was glad to find, that the Effect of thoſe Studies, which had drawn upon me the weight of an Arbitrary Government, might at leaſt entitle me to the Protection of a Government, which roſe, like the <hi>Phenix,</hi> from the Aſhes of the other; and was founded in ſuch a Conſent as gives Eſtabliſhment to our Laws.</p>
                  <p>Some may think I carry the Point too far, and prove more than is fitting; they at leaſt for whoſe Conviction ſo much was needful, that they may gain ſtrength to their Party, will repreſent all that oppoſe their Extream as embark'd in the other. And as they were juſtly become odious to all People who had any love for the <hi>Engliſh Liberties,</hi> they will be ſure to run down others as <hi>Common-wealths Men,</hi> not fit to live and breath in a <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to give the Objection its full weight,<note place="margin">The Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance, or Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, no way concern'd in the Controverſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By a Lay-Gentleman.</note> I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as it has been managed by a <hi>Lay-Gentleman,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the Doctrine of the <hi>Bowſtring</hi> was juſt to the <hi>late King,</hi> and would be ſerviceable to <hi>this</hi>; but that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is dangerous to all <hi>Crowned Heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And while I vindicate them who expoſe the modern Notion of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> I will ſhew that they who may be preſumed beſt to underſtand their own Doctrine, in effect condemn him for a <hi>Renegado.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Lay-Gentleman</hi> abſurdly labours to prove, That they who would not aſſiſt their <hi>Prince,</hi> to maintain that Power which they had beyond meaſure advanced, and were both in Principle and Practice, againſt contributing towards our
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:44505:5"/>
preſent happy Settlement, are, for thoſe very Reaſons, the only Perſons fit to be truſted under it.</p>
                  <p>The greater his Abilities are, and the larger his fore-ſight of Conſequences, the more is he confounded in the Defence of thoſe of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> who have made the greateſt Noiſe for that ſpurious <hi>Non-reſiſting Doctrine,</hi> which he, and they, would impoſe upon our <hi>Church</hi> as its genuine Senſe.</p>
                  <p>While he, like a true Son of the Church, takes the Rules of his Obedience, and of judging in Civil Affairs, not from the Laws and Legiſlative Power, but from the Biſhops; upon which account alone, he will have the Truth of our King's Declaration,<note place="margin">The Doctrine of Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> when he was Prince, not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, becauſe, forſooth, <hi>all the ſame things in a manner are complain'd of in the Biſhop's Propoſals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, if Matters of Fact, or Points of Law, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> 'tis not for the profane Laity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this hallowed Ground, without their Licenſe; and for them to take it from the Church, is ſuch a ſort of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg, as Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and others, charge upon our <hi>Reformers,</hi> for alienating and clearing the Nurſeries of Superſtition.</p>

                  <p>The not reſiſting the <hi>King,</hi> or any <hi>commiſſioned by him,</hi> but being wholly paſſive, when our Conſtitution and Laws are notoriouſly violated, and we are <hi>perſecuted</hi> againſt Law.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And the truth of it is generally, to avoid Suſpicion, he ſufficiently loads the late <hi>King</hi>; yet it is not without reaſon, that the boldeſt Talkers have formerly been ſuſpected to

have ſecret Indulgence;<note place="margin">The Deſign of the Author of the Magiſtracy and Government vindicated.</note> but in this he is ſomething more politick than the Author of the <hi>Vindication of the Magiſtracy and Government of</hi> England, who would make his Court to this Government by juſtifying the laſt; yet this Gentleman's Policy is no more than needful, when he contends that to excuſe them of the Engliſh Nation, who have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental towards <hi>the late Revolution,</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>zealous Gentleman</hi> need not wonder,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>This Gentleman does not obſerve, that the Queſtion is of one who ceaſes to be <hi>King,</hi> according to that of <hi>Bracton, non eſt Rex ubi dominatur voluntas, &amp; non Lex,</hi> which is not barely his Opinion, but warranted by that noble Tranſcript of the Original Contract, the <hi>Confeſſor's</hi> Law, which ſhews, that if a King does not anſwer the true end for which he was choſen, he loſes the Name, or ceaſes to be <hi>King,</hi> which was very vvell underſtood by <hi>J.</hi> 1. who told his Parliament,<note place="margin">Vid.

And thus the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> vvho reſiſted the Emperor, notwithſtanding their Oaths of Fidelity to him,<note place="margin">Hornii or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Polit. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> pleaded that they reſiſted him not as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but <hi>qua non fuit Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Author confeſſes that the late King notoriouſly ſubverted our Conſtitution,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.</note> did not treat us like Engliſh-Men, but Slaves, and ſays, all grant his deſign vvas <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to extirpate the Proteſtant Religion,</hi>

                     <hi>to enſlave, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to extirpate the Engliſh Nation.</hi> And I dare appeal to Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi>'s Chriſtian Loyalty to try ours by in ſuch caſe,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Loyalty.</note> where there vvas a manifeſt Renunciation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an Engliſh <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely no Man of Senſe vvill ſay, that ſuch a liberty for reſiſting, as this Lay-Gentleman imputes to the <hi>Williamites,</hi> can be the Conſequence of reſiſting ſuch a Prince as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, and of exploding that Sycophantry which did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and would ſupport him; or that the <hi>beſt of Princes can need the influence of that Doctrine,</hi> vvhich hurried on the other to his Ruin: the inſinuation of this is the greateſt Reflection which can be put, not only upon the <hi>Friends of their preſent Majeſties,</hi> but upon <hi>their Majeſties</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Tho ſome would have been ſo ungrateful to have ſent his <hi>Majeſty</hi> back uncrowned, after he had reſcued them from their preſent Fright, which might ſoon have been laid vvith a fevv flattering Careſſes; the Engliſh Nation abhors ſuch a Reproach: nor can their <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their own Nature, to violate that Conſtitution
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:44505:6"/>
which they have reſtored; nor yet can the confuting their ſlaviſh <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi>

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 36.</note> in the leaſt derogate from that <hi>religious Awe and Reverence, which is due to Crowned Heads</hi>: tho it may remove that Bugbear and <hi>Mormo,</hi> with which ſome would fright Mankind out of love with them.</p>
                  <p>Nor can any good Prince's Crown be unſecure, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the deceitful Officiouſneſs of others; ſince nothing can hazard it, but ſuch extravagant Actions as a well-diſpos'd Prince can never fall into, and which by <hi>natural</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as well as Equity, provoke a whole Nation. The Laws make all Riſings againſt the King puniſhable with Death, and therefore ſingle Perſons or Companies, in their ſound Minds, will not attempt them, but when the Cauſe is ſo apparent, that they who ſuffer them to ſtand alone in it, do but invite and encourage Attempts upon the Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of all: But if, as often ſuch there are, hot Men over-valuing themſelves, or the Strength of their Adherents, will endeavour to deſtroy a good Government to raiſe their Faction, or accompliſh ſome low Ends of their own; the Prince has ſufficient Security with the Laws and Hearts of his People on his ſide: And how ſtrict ſoever the Laws are, 'tis a vain thing to expect Safety from them alone, when any part of that Authority from which they flow, is render'd cheap, or invaded with an high hand. And they who think to get above all Law, will find their open Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to give the ſame Freedom to others, which they take to themſelves.</p>

                  <p>Herein I confeſs he makes a true Repreſentation of that <hi>Principle</hi> which himſelf runs into ſo naturally, that he is not ſenſible of it.</p>

                     <hi>it was alſo as unlawful to aſſiſt him, and enable to deſtroy the true Religion, the Engliſh Liberties and Immunities, nay the very Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is evident, that if our preſent <hi>King</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Incouragement from many in this Nation who had promiſed, and were ready to aſſiſt him as occaſion might ſerve, the bare non-reſiſting the late King and his Army, had enabled him to <hi>deſtroy the Engliſh Nation,</hi> which 'tis granted that he was bent upon; and therefore aſſiſting our preſent King was not only no Sin, but a Duty, by the ſame reaſon that it was a Duty not to aſſiſt the other.</p>
                  <p>But they who are of a contrary Opinion can by no means excuſe themſelves, for not fighting for the <hi>late King,</hi> or endeavouring to aſſiſt him, when he ſtood in need, and required it of them; for if he continued their lawful <hi>King,</hi> whom they were bound not to reſiſt upon any account whatſoever, according to this Advocate for the <hi>Non-aſſiſters,</hi> they were obliged to obey all his <hi>legal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:44505:9"/>This they were certainly bound to againſt a Foreign Force, for Preſervation of that Head of the Government, which, notwithſtanding the moſt tyrannical Sway, they will have ſtill to be <hi>God's Miniſters</hi> to them <hi>for good,</hi>

                  <p>Nor is this <hi>Gentleman</hi> more happy in appealing to <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Antiquity</hi> to juſtify the <hi>Non-aſſiſting,</hi> than he has been for the <hi>Non-reſiſting Doctrine</hi>: For thoſe Fathers who forbad a Souldier's Life, did it not as 'twas in the Service of <hi>Pagan Emperors,</hi> but upon Suppoſition that the uſe of the Sword was unlawful for them to whom they gave the Precept, to which end <hi>he that takes the Sword ſhall periſh by the Sword,</hi> was applied, which yet was originally meant, only of taking it up without a lawful Call.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Tertullian,</hi> on whoſe Authority our <hi>Non-reſiſter</hi> relies, agrees that they who had taken the Military Oath to <hi>Pagan Emperors</hi> before Baptiſm, were bound to fight for them; according to which, they who had ſworn Allegiance to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>lawful Succeſſors,</hi> and to defend the Rights of the Crown; nay, all they who had ſworn at any time before our <hi>Seers</hi> had their Eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, by their feeling the Effects of their own Doctrine, were, upon pain of Damnation, to fight for the <hi>late King,</hi> till the chance of War had decided the Controverſy.</p>
                  <p>And whatever liberty of judging he charges as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the <hi>reſiſting Doctrine,</hi> will fall upon the <hi>non-aſſiſting,</hi> which is as truly a departure from Duty, and as great a breach of the Oath of Allegiance, while the Duty of Allegiance remains, as the other. Let him aſſign the time from whence it was a Duty not to aſſiſt, and I ſhall not ſcruple to pronounce, that from that very time Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was as warrantable, and more honourable.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe, for once, that the Primitive Fathers were againſt fighting for <hi>Pagan Emperors,</hi> as they were <hi>Pagans,</hi> and to bring it home to the late Caſe that the <hi>Proteſtant Jacobites</hi> were excuſable from fighting for the <hi>late King,</hi>
                     <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:44505:10"/>
as he was a Papiſt; would not this be a virtual diſabling him from being <hi>King</hi> of this Proteſtant Nation? for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as it is an undoubted Prerogative, or Priviledg of this <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> for the King to make War and Peace when he judges it fitting, notwithſtanding Mens Oaths to defend all the Regal Priviledges, they were not bound to defend this, eſpecially if the War were againſt Proteſtants; in which caſe, the Subject would take to himſelf the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Juſtice, or Expedience of the War, as much as others do of the neceſſity of reſiſting.</p>
                  <p>Or, ſuppoſe yet farther, that the <hi>late King</hi> had diſcharged his Mercenaries, and commanded the <hi>Militia,</hi> by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd for the Defence of the Kingdom, to march and fight againſt his preſent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> had not this been a <hi>legal Command?</hi> The King's <hi>legal Commands,</hi> he agrees with me, that we are bound to obey, yet he with all agrees, that it was unlawful to aſſiſt the late King againſt This, before he was crown'd: How then can the matter be adjuſted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yeilding, that the late King loſt his <hi>Regal Power</hi> by aſſuming a <hi>Tyrannical</hi> one?</p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew, that they who reſiſted the late King, did it not out of Principles either <hi>Anti-chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Anti-monarchical;</hi> and that they who are for the <hi>non-reſiſting Doctrine,</hi> as it paſt for current in the laſt Reign and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, and yet pretend a Zeal for the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do but daub with untempered Mortar; and as they were not to contribute to the <hi>late Revolution,</hi> ſo much as in their Prayers, but on the contrary were to pray for the late <hi>King's Victory over all his Enemies,</hi> and in effect that God would <hi>keep and ſtrengthen</hi> him in his Kingdom, as well as in that Worſhip, which they could not but know not to be <hi>God's true Worſhip</hi>; So if that miſguided Prince ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>Ireland,</hi> and return into their Arms, for a Puniſhment of thoſe Opinions which occaſioned his Ruine, their pretended Loyalty to this King, if they prove true to their Principles, muſt fall to the ground: And the leaſt puff of Wind, adverſe to us, but proſperous to the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> would blow up that Fire covered with deceitful Aſhes, to the extinguiſhing of which I ſhall readily devote my Service.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lay-Gentleman</hi> who has extorted my Reflections, by his indecent Cenſure of the Subjects of this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> who
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:44505:10"/>
contributed towards the <hi>late Revolution,</hi> thinks it clear that the <hi>Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience</hi> is no way concern'd in the Controverſies now depending, between the Friends, and no Friends, if not Enemies to their <hi>preſent Majeſties</hi>; having, in his vain Imagination, put it paſt queſtion that the <hi>Williamites</hi> were neither <hi>good Subjects</hi> under the late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, nor <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>true Members</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>: And that his <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>true Members</hi> are the only Perſons, whoſe Principles may be relied on now.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſince he will have the Senſe of the Church to be known from the Cry of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſuppoſed to be a Martyr for it, may be preſum'd to give the Senſe of that Truth, which he would be thought to atteſt to the laſt.</p>

                  <p>And all the Authority which can be deriv'd from the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Dying-Declaration, to prove the <hi>Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience</hi> to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> equally proves that this is eſſential to the Controverſies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, between the Friends of the late Government, and the happy Subjects of this.</p>
                  <p>As a juſt Corollary from which, we may affirm, that no Man who is true to the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> or <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> can bear Faith and true Allegiance to our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen.</hi> In conſequence to which, as I have above ſhewn, ſuch are bound to their Power to aſſiſt the late King, and to maintain the Regal Rights which he ſtill claims, as King of <hi>England</hi>; if they are entruſted with any of our <hi>King</hi>'s Secrets, to reveal them to the other; and to employ all thoſe Advantages, which his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> Favour may give them,<note place="margin">Preface to the Hiſt. of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> towards the advancing that Intereſt, to which they believe themſelves <hi>unalterably</hi> bound.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Biſhop will have this Doctrine of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to be the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Character</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therein admits, that ſhe holds it in a manner differing from all other Proteſtant Churches.

And how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome may be concern'd to keep up the Diſtinction, 'tis to be hoped that we ſhall be more wiſe, and more true to the Intereſt of the Church univerſal.</p>
                  <p>If, as the Biſhop ſays, the Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> has taught this, and this is <hi>the diſtinguiſhing Character</hi> of this Church, vvill not Men ſay that he makes this Church to have a Religion as well as Ceremonies of its own?</p>

                  <p>The Reaſons of this <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s maintaining and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to propagate his Opinion, to the Diſturbance of our preſent Settlement (next to his Obligations to the late King, which the firſt miſunderſtanding was not to erace) were apparently,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſourneſs of the <hi>Milk,</hi> which he had ſuck'd in from his Nurſe or Mother; which is known to have a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Conſtitution of the Body, and that upon
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:44505:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Mind; inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Dreyden,</hi> and ſome other ſuch Philoſophers, have inſinuated that the Soul is nothing elſe but the Temperament of the Body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The prejudice of his Education, whereby he was taught to believe this to be part of his Baptiſmal Vow. Which being the only Reaſon that he has thought fit to bleſs us with, as judging it ſufficient; in following this Epiſcopal Authority, he who was bred a <hi>Pagan</hi> ought to be a <hi>Pagan</hi> ſtill: And if we believe a topping Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s natural Fanatick, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England.</hi> F.</note> the <hi>Pagans</hi> can produce better Reaſons for their Infidelity, not only than any we have yet had for this <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing</hi> Piece of Religion, but, than can be brought for Belief in the true God, without having recourſe to the Scriptures interpreted by the Church. But the Church which he complemented being the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Popery of his Notion went down very glibly at that time, as the Authority of this ſingle Biſhop does with many now.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Weakneſs of his Judgment, which is obvious, not only in the wording his dying-Paper in ſuch a manner, as either condemns his own Church of Singularity, or all others of Corruption, in departing from that Religion which ſhe alone has the honour to profeſs; but farther yet, if he were in his ſound Mind at the ſubſcribing his own, or Dr. <hi>H.</hi> his Confeſſion of Faith, he would have reflected, that tho he might have done enough to quiet his own Mind, he had not us'd due means for informing himſelf of what he ought to preſs upon others, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary matter of Belief; having debated it either with Divines, who are but ſecond-hand Caſuiſts for this, or elſe with <hi>Lay-men</hi> of the <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Opinion, who would maintain the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it out of the Controverſy which it has rais'd and keeps up.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this without grounds: for in debate with a Divine of our Church, whoſe great Worth, Learning, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and Integrity have juſtly rais'd him above all degrees in Station; the Biſhop did frankly confeſs, that he believ'd the Queſtion to iſſue in a Point of Law: And for his Satisfaction he had diſcours'd with a certain <hi>eloquent Perſon,</hi> whom he nam'd, ſuppos'd to have <hi>ſuck'd in</hi> Law with his <hi>Milk,</hi> as the Biſhop did his new Divinity, nurſs'd
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:44505:14"/>
up ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days. But this <hi>Perſon</hi> being one who has acted upon the ſame Principle, and makes it his Glory not to have his Opinion alter'd by his place; I think no Man who obſerves what lame work the <hi>Lay-Gentleman</hi> has made, of endeavouring to reconcile the <hi>Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience</hi> with Submiſſion to our preſent Government, will wonder, that he could not receive Satisfaction from one, who held the ſame Premiſes with himſelf, but denies the Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>This ground for the Biſhop's Pertinaciouſneſs, I muſt own, is not evident to all: but his conſulting Dr. <hi>H.</hi> is; who, I may well ſay, is hardened and ſteel'd in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion beyond hopes of Conviction; ſince by the Writer of this,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Letter to</hi> Jovian, <hi>Ed. An.</hi> 1683. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> he was long ſince admoniſh'd, of having ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abus'd thoſe Authorities on which he relied, and of having, by his Conceſſions and Contradictions, fully ſet aſide all that he would enforce: and this at a time, when this Writer ran the utmoſt hazard by expoſing a Man, thought ſo highly to have ſerv'd them who were in Power, and called themſelves the Government; And when the Doctor, by refuting the Objections, might have had the Reward, as vvell as boaſt of a Triumph.</p>
                  <p>Yet for the Comfort of them vvhom he then trampled upon, he had diſabled himſelf of his Sting, vvhile he quitted the Authority of a Preacher of God's Law, for a partial Reporter, and Expounder of Man's.</p>
                  <p>His Errors or Perverſions, as far they concern our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſy and Government, may be reduced to two Heads.</p>

                  <p>And thus a King of <hi>England</hi> has Right to make his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Slaves when he pleaſes.

                  <p>Yet even in this Caſe he allows of no Reſiſtance, but that ſtill being upon Suppoſition that the Power, which was reſtrained in the Exerciſe (a Power to act, and not to act) was veſted abſolutely in the <hi>Soveraign</hi>; till he proves it ſo here, all his Authorities from Scripture, Homilies, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, fall beſide the Queſtion, which is of one aſſuming an <hi>abſolute,</hi> or <hi>imperial Power,</hi> when the Conſtitution gave no more than <hi>Political</hi> one;<note place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>Wherefore from the whole it follows,</p>

                  <p>Before the Judges have been appointed, he concludes, that Mr. <hi>Johnſon's Head is due</hi> for writing againſt the late King's Title: and, vvith at leaſt as much Equity, we may ſay, that his Head <hi>is due,</hi> for writing againſt the Title of this.</p>
                  <p>But ſince he is willing to loſe his Head, if he cannot ſatisfy ſuch Judges, it is a pretty ſort of Indemnity which he deſires, not to loſe his Head for any thing which he may offer before the Judges; when he conſents to loſe it, if what he offers is not back'd with ſatisfactory Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Has he more to preſs, or could he do it more cogently, than Men of his Mind did in Parliament, where there was full liberty of Speech? Or is it to be ſuppos'd, that there vvas not as good a Diſpoſition in the Majority of them whoſe Votes carry'd our Settlement, to liſten to ſuch <hi>unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Reaſons,</hi> as he can expect from any appointed to be Judges of the Controverſy; but perhaps, obſerving what Indulgence his Principle has met with, he may hope that he, or Men of the ſame Leven might influence the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Judges; and 'tis evident that therein muſt lie the only colourable ground of his confident and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Challenge.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein I fear he vvounds himſelf, while he thinks to hit Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> in the Eye, for his due Application of the ſelf-evident Diſtinction between <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>no Law</hi>: and tho there is no Law to reach Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> for his Reflections upon the late King and his Title; this Writer may find a Law to puniſh him.

                     <p>His Treatiſe is in two Parts, in the firſt he vindicates and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to explain the Oath of Supremacy.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In relation to the Regal Power, as it is receiv'd in our Church, or at leaſt by Church-men, or as it is acknowledged by our Laws.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the Oath renounces all Foreign Juriſdiction, the laſt of which falls no otherwiſe under Conſideration here, than as it ſhews the King's Duty to preſerve his Eccleſiaſtical, as well as Civil Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and not to alienate either.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Page 14.</note>1. In the firſt he rightly affirms, That <hi>the aſſerting the Supremacy of Government is never deſign'd</hi> (meaning I ſupppoſe, by the Law) <hi>in any wiſe to violate either Divine or Chriſtian Inſtitutions, or to aſſert it lawful for any Prince to invade that Authority and Right, which is made particular thereby, whether in Matters Temporal or Spiritual.</hi> Where by <hi>Chriſtian Inſtitutions,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Page 356.</note> he ſeems to mean the Perſon of the <hi>King,</hi> and that not according to his own Definition of a <hi>King,</hi> which he ſays <hi>doth denote the Royal Perſon who governs,</hi> which himſelf owns to be according to the reſpective Limitations in thoſe places where they govern, many having <hi>the Title of a King,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 339.</note> 
                        <hi>who had not ſuch Royal Power as is allowed by our Conſtitution:</hi> but he aſcribes to a King generally ſpeaking, and particularly to ours, ſuch a Soveraignty as carries with it the abſolute and arbitrary Exerciſe of that <hi>Civil Power</hi> whereby a Nation is govern'd.</p>
                     <p>Thus he aſſerts with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That <hi>Subjests may and ought to obey their Prince's Commands where they are certain,</hi>

                        <hi>that what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is not againſt the Command of God:</hi> And hence he attributes to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> even more Power than he allows to the Roman Chriſtian <hi>Emperors,</hi> as will ſoon appear. And it appears, that this is not only a caſual daſh with his Pen;<note place="margin">Page 123.</note> for having before in one place ſpoken of <hi>the buſineſs</hi> of the <hi>Civil Power</hi> deſcrib'd by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 131.</note> in another he mentions <hi>the Authority with which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Kings and Princes to be veſted to govern in Matters of Religion, not as originally ariſing from their Chriſtianity, but from the general Right of Dominion and Soveraignty, and ſays, this includeth a Right of eſtabliſhing, by their Authority, what is truly unblameable, orderly, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and neceſſary with reſpect to Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Accordingly he ſpeaks of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of <hi>Ina,</hi>

                     <p>And indeed if, as Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> has it elſewhere,<note place="margin">Page 41.</note>

                        </note> ſeeing, tho all the <hi>Canons</hi> of 1640, lie under a Cenſure of much greater Authority in our <hi>Church</hi> than that with which they were made; he cites the firſt Canon as the Senſe of our <hi>Church, That the moſt high and ſacred Order of Kings is of Divine Right, being the Ordinance of God himſelf, founded in the prime Laws of Nature, and clearly eſtabliſhed by the expreſs Texts both of the Old and New Teſtaments:</hi> upon this ground he might well ſuppoſe that the People in chuſing a King (which he allows often to have been <hi>where there hath been a Vacancy, and none could claim a Right of Succeſſion</hi>) whatever Terms or <hi>Contract</hi> were made at the Choice,<note place="margin">Page 414.

                     </p>
                     <p>And if the Rights of Princes, or any of them are aſcertain'd by <hi>God</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Page 423.</note> not by the ancient Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or expreſs <hi>Contract</hi>; then indeed, even in <hi>Elective Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> thoſe Divine Rights of Soveraingty, as well as ſuch as ariſe from the Original, or more immediate Contract, <hi>are inveſted in the Perſon elected thereto before the Coronation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to qualify this, 'tis to be conſider'd, that he contends that the Declaration againſt taking Arms relates particularly <hi>to the King, not indefinitely to any King, and can bare no other Conſtruction, than to condemn the Engliſh Subjects taking Arms againſt their natural So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign the King of</hi> England:<note place="margin">Page 338.</note> 
                        <hi>and therefore, tho the like Attempts againſt any other Kings who enjoy Soveraign Authority, are equally blameable in their Subjects; yet this Poſition,</hi> ſays he, <hi>does not aſſert the utter unlawfulneſs of taking Arms amongſt any other Nations, againſt him who hath the Title of King; if he doth not therewith enjoy that Right of Supream Government, which our Kings have and exerciſe.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Page 542.</note>4. <hi>The only thing which,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Falkner, in this Caſe can farther be propoſed is, Whether if a Supream Governour ſhould according to his own Pleaſure, and contrary to the eſtabliſhed Laws, and his Subjects Property, actually engage upon the deſtroying and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44505:34"/>
ruining a conſiderable part of his People, they might not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by taking Arms?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This which he ſays <hi>is notional</hi> and <hi>ſpeculative,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 543.</note> has too ſadly been reduced to Practice, in <hi>Ireland</hi> eſpecially.</p>
                     <p>After mentioning the Pariſian Maſſacre, he <hi>confeſſes,</hi> that <hi>if ever any ſuch ſtrange Caſe as is propos'd, really happen in the World,</hi>

                        <hi>it would have great Difficulties.

And,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Falkner, if this be true, it muſt be upon this ground, that ſuch Attempts of ruining do,</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a diſclaiming the governing thoſe Perſons as Subjects,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 545.</note> 
                        <hi>and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of being their Prince or King. And then the Expreſſions of our Publick Declaration and Acknowledgment would ſtill be ſecur'd, that it is not lawful upon any Pretence whatſoever to take Arms againſt the King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi>'s Judgment in theſe three, or rather four Caſes, is this, That theſe Caſes are ſo <hi>extraordinary,</hi> that they fall not under any Conſideration <hi>as a pretence,</hi> but will juſtify the Subjects taking Arms when they are <hi>real</hi>; and that when any ſuch Caſe happens, the taking Arms is not ſo much authoriz'd by any Judicial Power in the People, or their Repreſentatives, as by the Facts themſelves, whereby the King <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> without Sentence, incurs a <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> and ceaſes to be <hi>King.</hi> And had he lived to apply his own Rules, no Man can doubt but he would in Terms have juſtified our renouncing Allegiance to the late King: Whether upon the account of the <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> or the Judgment upon it, or both, is not very material: eſpecially conſidering that both <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeak of an Abſolute Prince, not a Platonick Monarchy,<note place="margin">Vid.

                     <p>TO proceed to poſitive Law, I ſhall ſhew how the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between Prince and People ſtood, and hath been taken, both before the reputed Conqueſt, and ſince: Where 'twill appear.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Allegiance might, and may in ſome Caſes be withdrawn, in the Life-time of one who continued King, until the occaſion of ſuch withdrawing, or Judgment upon it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there was and is an eſtabliſh'd Judicature for this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of recurring to that Equity, which the People are ſuppos'd to have reſerv'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That there has been no abſolute Hereditary Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> from the beginning of the Monarchy; but that the People have had a Latitude, for ſetting up whom of the Blood they pleas'd, upon the Determination of the Intereſt of any particular Perſon, except where there has been a Settlement of the Crown in force.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That they were lately reſtored to ſuch Latitude.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The People of <hi>England</hi> have duly exercis'd their Power in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>recognizing</hi> them to be <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Rightful</hi> King and Queen.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                        <p>The Barons Wars in the time of King <hi>John;</hi> That he had abdicated the Government; That he had loſt all means of being truſted by his People. How unwilling they were to engage in a War againſt him. They invite over <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dauphin of <hi>France.</hi> His Caſe a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the late Abdication. The Vacancy of the Throne inſiſted on by the French King's Advocate, and that thereupon the Barons had right to chuſe another King, of the Blood Royal of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Lewis</hi> was. Why the Barons fell off from <hi>Lewis.</hi> What the <hi>Homilies</hi> ſay concerning their inviting <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſwearing Allegiance to him, and fighting under his Banner againſt King <hi>John,</hi> conſidered.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Power lodg'd in the People for the publick Good to be ſure was rous'd and juſtified by the Tyrannical Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> who, tho he had effectually <hi>abdicated,</hi> or unking'd himſelf, by his giving up his Crown, as much as in him lay, to hold in Vaſſallage of the Pope, as well as by other his Exorbitances; yet was not ſet aſide till the Nation was neceſſitated to it, by the Succeſs of his Uſurpations and Ravages, to which, as he was encouraged and enabled, by the Influence of the Pope's Authority, over the leſs honeſt, or leſs diſcerning; ſo he thereby loſt all means of gaining Truſt from his People for the future.</p>
                     <p>The Earls and Barons of <hi>England</hi> having, without any Writ from the King, given one another notice of meeting, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that they engag'd not out of any Affectation of Change, but meerly to ſecure thoſe Liberties which were their due by the Conſtitution; for they agreed to wage War,<note place="margin">Mat. Pa. <hi>f.</hi> 339.</note> and renounce Allegiance to him only, in caſe that he would not confirm thoſe Liberties, which were contain'd in the Laws of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. and the ancient Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>That they might proceed with ſuch Deliberation as became them, they appointed another Meeting for a peremptory Demand, declaring that if he then refus'd them, they would compel him to Satisfaction by ſeizing his Caſtles: nor were they worſe than their words, and their Reſolutions had for a while their deſir'd Effect, in obtaining a Confirmation of their Liberties: which tho they were as forceable in Law before, and his Promiſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them as little to be credited as ever; yet his open Violation of them after his own ſolemn acknowledging them, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> was likely to caſt the greater Load upon him and his Courtiers, when they ſhould act to the contrary; and to take from their ſide numbers of well-meaning Men,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44505:44"/>
who otherwiſe might be cheated with a pretence of Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
                     <p>The Pope, as was to be expected, ſoon abſolv'd the King, and encourag'd him to break thoſe legal Fetters, which was <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> an Abſolution to the People, of more effect in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than the <hi>Pope's ipſo facto</hi> Excommunications.</p>
                     <p>They being thus diſcharged, the wiſer and ſounder part of them, ſtoutly caſting off the Authority both of King and Pope, proceeded to the Election of another King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dauphin of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>TO proceed to the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. who was Crown'd by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> while <hi>Lewis</hi> was in poſſeſſion of <hi>London,</hi> the Metropolis of the Kingdom; That he came not to the Crown as Succeſſor in an <hi>Hereditary Monarchy,</hi> but upon a plain <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Compact,</hi> with part of the Nation at leaſt, in the Name of the reſt who would come in under thoſe terms, may be prov'd beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: For tho' in the Language of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> King <hi>John</hi> were <hi>Natural Lord</hi> to the Subjects of <hi>England</hi>; yet as <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was the next in the Line to King <hi>John</hi>'s Predeceſſor, had the Right of Blood,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">2. The Father came to the Crown by virtue of a Free Election of the People, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> told him at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore his Election could not inveſt him with more than a Perſonal Right, unleſs more were expreſs'd at the time.

And being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ask'd why he took ſuch freedom of Speech? He declar'd, That he foreſaw, and was aſſur'd by Ancient Prophecies, That <hi>King John</hi> would <hi>corrupt</hi> the <hi>Kingdom and Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and precipitate it into great confuſion:</hi> And he aſſerted, That he ought to be minded of his coming to the Crown by <note n="*" place="margin">Ne haberet liberas hab<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Election,</hi> not by <hi>Hereditary Succeſſion,</hi> leaſt he ſhould take a liberty to act as he fear'd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Since therefore what the Archbiſhop fear'd, came to paſs; and that <hi>Contract,</hi> in virtue of which King <hi>John</hi> aſſum'd the Royal Scepter, was notoriouſly broken, How can it be thought that a Right devolv'd upon his Son <hi>H.</hi> 3. eſpecially conſidering the interruption that was made by a Choice of <hi>Lewis,</hi> tho' not Univerſal?</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs, there is no Evidence occurring to me, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was ever Crown'd here; yet conſidering that the Coronation, as is agreed by moſt, is but a Ceremony, the bare want of it would not the leſs argue a breach in the Succeſſion, ſince the ſounder part of the people
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44505:46"/>
took the benefit of that Forfeiture which <hi>King John</hi> manifeſtly made: and if nothing but an Univerſal Concurrence in this, could juſtify with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Allegiance from him, then it is hardly poſſible for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Tyranny to be lawful at the begining; and he who is forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Cauſe of his Country, muſt be always a Criminal.</p>
                     <p>But being there is a deep ſilence as to <hi>Lewis</hi> his Coronation,<note place="margin">Mat. Par. Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Coronan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> tho he was promis'd by the <hi>Barons</hi> at <hi>London</hi> to be Crown'd immediately upon his coming over; I take the reaſon of the ſilence in this matter to be, That if he were Crown'd in form, it was by the <hi>Laity</hi> alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope was faſt to the ſide of <hi>King John,</hi> and his Son; and <hi>Lewis</hi> lay under a Papal Sentence of Excommunication, ſo that the Clergy durſt not Communicate with him in thoſe Acts of Religious Worſhip, which accompany Coronations. But theſe Ceremonies being to be performed by Clergy-men, 'tis moſt probable, that the Laity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with the Subſtance, and left thoſe Ceremonies for a more convenient time. But that <hi>Lewis</hi> was in Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Regalia,</hi> is to be believed, as <hi>London,</hi> with the <hi>Tower,</hi> where they us'd to be lodg'd, had not only been in the Poſſeſſion of his Friends from the beginning, but held ſo till the ſecond Year after <hi>H.</hi> had been Crown'd, as it is to be preſum'd, with a Crown made for that purpoſe. Whether <hi>Lewis</hi> were Crown'd or no, he was as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by them that had withdrawn their Allegiance from King <hi>John,</hi> as if he had been Crown'd; and reciprocal Oaths paſt between them. And he was ſo far lookt on as <hi>King,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. Par.</note> that <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> ſwore Homage to him, for the Lands he held of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But certain it is, as the Circumſtances evince, that there were at leaſt three Expreſs and Binding Contracts which <hi>H.</hi> 3. entred into with his People, either beyond, or rather explanatory of what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>Coronation-Oath,</hi> and which <hi>H.</hi> 3. was bound to obſerve, as he would be King of <hi>England</hi>; and theſe, beſides ſeveral Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Great Charter, purchas'd</hi> with the <hi>Peoples</hi> Money; and one of the Grants of Aid ſo particularly <hi>Conditional,</hi> that Treaſurers for it were appointed in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the Money was to be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon the King's not performing the Conditions of the Grant.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Firſt <hi>Contract</hi> which I ſhall obſerve, was that which <hi>Lewis,</hi> perhaps induc'd to it by the Money which he borrowed of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,</hi> oblig'd <hi>H.</hi> to, before he would quit his Pretenſions: So that one was plainly the Condition of the other; and as the <hi>Civilians</hi> have it, ran into the other by way of Mutual Conſideration.<note place="margin">Vid. inf.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lewis,</hi> for the reaſons which I before touch'd upon, finding his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt daily decline, thought good to come to terms with <hi>Henry,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Lewis</hi> oblig'd himſelf by Oath to withdraw from <hi>England,</hi>

And perhaps its own breaking up in Confuſion before, was in Law an Adjournment, <hi>ſine die,</hi> working a diſſolution; by either of which, that Parliament was Diſſolved more than three years before the meeting of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which made the Statute in queſtion; which Parliament Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. and was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſſolved, when it attempted to make thoſe Statutes; it having been continued by Prorogation or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment beyond the Tenth of <hi>September,</hi> in the third year after the Diſſolution of the laſt Parliament of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, which was the next foregoing legal Parliament, according to ſtrict form: For the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which brought in <hi>Charles</hi> 2. <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. was not ſummoned by the King's Writs; conſequently the Parliament 1661. having, according to them, no power after it had continued as above; whatever was the Ancient Law in this Matter, remains as it did before thoſe Laws.</p>

                        <hi>Seſellius,</hi> at that time, looked upon <hi>France</hi> as an Hereditary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, in which he admits, that there may be great inconveniencies through the folly, vice, or minority of a Succeſſour to a good Prince, or the wickedneſs of thoſe who execute the Government during his minority; yet ſays he,
<q>There are remedies at hand, by which we may reſtrain a King Reigning Arbitrarily, and them who have the care of one who cannot Govern for want of fit Age; ſo that the King may have the Dignity which belongs to him, and yet it may not be lawful for him to do what he pleaſes, but what is agreeable to Law and Equity. Proviſion is made for this by the beſt Laws, and moſt Sacred Eſtabliſhments, which may not be violated without great hazard, although ſometimes force is offered to them.</q>

                     <p>He tells us, their Kings have, <hi>as it were, three Bridles, with which their Soveraign Power is reſtrained:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Seſellius, <hi>f.</hi> 269.</note> 1. Religion; And if the awe of that is not ſufficiently impreſſed upon him, yet the reverence of ſome Holy Man may prevail; it being <hi>allowable for any Biſhop, or other Eccleſiaſtical perſon of an unblameable life, and in eſteem with the people, to admoniſh him of his Duty</hi>; nor can he uſe any ſeverities to his Admoniſher, <hi>without danger of alienating the affections of his people.</hi> 2. The Juriſdiction of the <hi>Senate</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> whoſe Power, he ſays,<note place="margin">Ut decretis ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorum Rex quoque pareat. Vid.

The <hi>Polity,</hi> or Laws of the Kingdom, which temper the Regal Authority, this he ſays, is greatly to the Honour of their Kings; <hi>For if they could do every thing, they would be much more imperfect: And as it does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from God Almighty that he cannot ſin, but his perfection is the more illuſtrious, and to be admired for this very reaſon; ſo Kings, when they obey their Laws, deſerve the greater praiſe, and come nigher to perfection, than if they could command all things at their will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>

                     <p>Among his ſeveral Arguments, to refute the pretenſions of the Court of <hi>France</hi> to Arbitrary Power, one is,<note place="margin">Memoire 7.</note>
                        <q>That <hi>nothing of great importance ought to be done within the Realm,<note place="margin">P. 97.</note> but with the advice and conſent of the Eſtates</hi>; inſomuch, ſays he, That the Government of <hi>France</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arſtocratical</hi> than <hi>Monarchical</hi>; or at leaſt it is a Monarchy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd by an <hi>Ariſtocracy, <hi>exactly ſuch an one as</hi>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſum of his Authorities upon this Head, he reduces to theſe particulars:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'The <hi>Estates</hi> of the Kingdom may <hi>Chuſe</hi> and <hi>Depoſe</hi> their Kings,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 110.</note> 'and by conſequence may Judge them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'They may Judge between the People and the King.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. 'They may Judge between King and King, when more than 'one aſpire, and pretend to the Crown.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. 'They Determine the Differences which Kings have with their 'Subjects.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. 'They give Tutors to Kings, and Regents to the Realm.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. 'They diſpoſe of the great Offices of State.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. 'They make Ordinances, which alone have the Force of Law 'within the Realm.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. 'They regulate the Affairs of Money.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. 'They appoint Impoſitions and Levies of Taxes.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. 'They are to be conſulted upon all great Affairs.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. 'In fine, They are, of right, to Correct all defaults of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'even thoſe of which their Kings are Authors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>By all theſe particulars, ſays he, it appears,<note place="margin">Soupirs Mem 7. p. 110.</note> that in ſome reſpects the States are ſuperiour to the King; for example, when they <hi>chuſe, depoſe, judge,</hi> and <hi>correct,</hi> and that in other matters <hi>they ſhare</hi> with the King in every part of the <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> He adds, If we have need of farther proof, the name <hi>Parliament,</hi> which all our Ancient <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> give the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>States,</hi> may furniſh us with one. This is the name which the <hi>Engliſh give this Aſſembly, which partakes of the Soveraignty with their King. The</hi> French, <hi>and the Ancient</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>had the ſame Laws, and the ſame Language; they Governed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by</hi> States, <hi>gave the ſame name to their</hi> Aſſemblies: <hi>And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt they had the ſame Authority.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <hi>Nay, it is certain that the</hi> States <hi>had formerly in</hi> France, <hi>the ſame Power that the</hi> Parliaments <hi>have in</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>As this Author makes the Liberties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and the Power of its Parliament, an Argument of the Right of the <hi>French</hi> Nation; <hi>Bodin,</hi> who wrote after their Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> had taken the place of the Aſſembly of States, makes <hi>England</hi> a parallel to <hi>France, Turky, Perſia, Muſcovy,</hi>

                        <hi>And in ſuch caſe it matters not whether the Virtuous Prince proceed againſt the Tyrant with Force, or Art, or way of Juſtice: True it is, if the Virtuous Prince has taken the Tyrant, he will have more Honour if he make his Proceſs, and puniſh him as a Murderer, or Parricide, or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, rather than to make uſe of the Law of Nations againſt him.</hi>

                     <p>This paſſage in <hi>Bodin</hi> ſhews beyond contradiction, That if he were now alive, and not of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and juſtified the Heroick undertaking of King <hi>William,</hi> for the delivery of this Nation. But the ground of the juſtification is, That even the moſt abſolute Soveraign may injure his Subjects, as no doubt but he would, if he treated them contrary to natural equity, and his own eſtabliſhed Laws;<note place="margin">Jovian, <hi>p.</hi> 226.</note> whereas the Author of <hi>Jovian</hi> having ſet up an Imperial Power above all Political Conſtitutions, ſays, <hi>In this Realm the Sovereign cannot wrong or injure his Subjects, but contrary to the Political Laws:</hi> And by conſequence not at all, if the Political Laws are to give way to the <hi>Imperial.</hi> Wherefore I wonder not to find him a Subſcriber to the late Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi>'s Paper, which condemns Swearing Allegiance to our preſent King and Queen. But <hi>Bodin,</hi> as he juſtifies our King <hi>William</hi> in freeing us from an oppreſſing Monarch, no leſs clears the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> in joyning with him, upon ſuppoſition that the Conſtitution of our Government is not rightly underſtood by him.</p>

                        <q>But, ſays he, as to Subjects, we ought to know whether the Prince be abſolutely Soveraign; or whether he is not abſolutely So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign: For if he is not abſolutely Soveraign, it is neceſſary that the Soveraignty be in the people, or in the Lords. In this caſe there is no doubt but it is lawful to proceed againſt the Tyrant by way of Juſtice, if we can prevail againſt him: or by way of Deeds and Force, if we cannot have Reaſon otherwiſe: as the Senate did againſt <hi>Nero</hi> in one caſe, and againſt <hi>Maximin</hi> in another; ſo that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were nothing elſe but Princes of the Common-wealth, that is to ſay, the Firſt and Chief, the Soveraignty remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the people and the Senate. As I have ſhewn, this Common-wealth may be called a Principality. Altho <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of his Scholar <hi>Nero,</hi> ſays, <hi>I alone, among all Men living, am elected and choſen to be God's Vicegerent on Earth. I am Arbiter of Life and Death; I am able at my pleaſure to diſpoſe of the eſtate and quality of any Man. True it is, that in fact he uſurped this Power; but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44505:55"/>
of right the State was but a Principality, where the people were Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign:</hi> As alſo is that of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who condemned to death their Duke <hi>Falier,</hi> and put to death others without form or figure of Proceſs. Inſomuch that <hi>Venice</hi> is an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Principality, where the Duke is but Cheif, and the Soveraignty remains with the States of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Noblemen.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>And in the like Caſe, the <hi>German</hi> Empire, which alſo is but an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Principality, where the Emperor is chief and firſt, the Power and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the Empire belongs to the <hi>States,</hi> who in the year 1296. depoſed the Emperor <hi>Adolph,</hi> and after him <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> in the year 1400. in form of juſtice, as having juriſdiction and power over them.</q>

                        <q>Through all our Hiſtory we may always ſee a very clear diſtinction between the Officers of the King's Houſe, and thoſe of the Crown: This diſtinction remains to this day, as a Monument of the Ancient Liberty of the <hi>French.</hi> For we ſay, the Great Maſter of the King's Houſhold, the <hi>Great Chamberlain,</hi> &amp;c. But we ſay the <hi>Conſtable of France,</hi> the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> the Chancellour of <hi>France:</hi> And theſe laſt Charges do not dye with the King; whereas the Officers of the King's Houſe dye with the King, and may be changed by his Succeſſour. The Reaſon of this difference comes from this, That that which is given by one King, may be taken away by another: But the Officers of the Crown being made by the People, and by the Realm, cannot be turn'd out by the King alone. And it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that theſe Offices <hi>of the Crown,</hi> which the States of the Kingdom may give, and which they alone can take away, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the whole, to the War, to Juſtice, and to the Finances, or Treaſury.</q>

<q>We may obſerve that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are in full Poſſeſſion of the Crown, immediately upon the Death of their Predeceſſors, and therefore King <hi>Edward</hi> 1. and <hi>H.</hi> 5. had Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance ſworn to them before their Coronation; whence, ſays he, it follows, that as ſwearing does not make them Kings, ſo neither can Perjury, tho truly objected, unmake them again.</q>

The Doctor owns, that though <hi>upon ſome extraordinary Revolution, and ſome abſolute neceſſary Reaſon of State, for our common preſervation, a Stranger,</hi> none of the Blood-Royal, <hi>ſhould be advanced to the Throne for one or more turns; whilſt that neceſſity continues, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government would not be alter'd.</hi> And yet would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Where <hi>ſaid Allegiance,</hi> ſhews it to be meant of Allegiance to the King <hi>de facto,</hi> whoſe <hi>Service</hi> is called <hi>true Duty.</hi> And no Man ſurely can think the meaning to be, that if after ſuch Service they turn to the other ſide, or become Traitors to the preſent Power, they ſhall ſuffer for the former Service as Traitors againſt him that had the Right, either during the Reign of the King in being, which would be an unlikely owning the Ejected Power; or hereafter, if that ſhould come to be reſtor'd; which would be far from anſwering the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent end of the Clauſe, which is to keep Men in obedience to him who has the Power of puniſhing the diſobedient. Wherefore the meaning may be, That no Man who departs from his Duty of Allegiance to the preſent King, ſhall ſave himſelf by pleading, that he had been in Arms, or had done him any ſignal Service. In ſhort, this was to be no <hi>Corban</hi> to Anſwer for any following departure from Duty.</p>

                        <note place="margin">That the People of <hi>England</hi> were lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Choice.</note>I Think I have with due regard to all colourable Objections, made it appear, That Allegiance may in ſome Caſes be withdrawn from one who had been King, till the occaſion of ſuch Withdrawing, or Judgment upon it.</p>
                     <p>And this I have done, not only from the Equity, and reſerved Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes neceſſarily implied, but from the expreſs Original and continuing Contract between Prince and People; which with the Legal Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture impowered to determine concerning it, I have likewiſe ſhewn, and exemplified by the Cuſtom of the Kingdom, both before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Conqueſt, and ſince.

                        <q>Dignity varies not with the change of Perſons: Whence, if any Subject or Soldier ſwear Fealty to his King or General, the Oath is to be meant to be made unto them alſo who ſucceed to that Dignity.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when the Crown continues in the Blood, this eſpecially by what I have above-ſhewn, puts the Obligation of Allegiance to the King in being, out of Controverſie, unleſs it can be made appear, that the Right of the former King remains; or that there is ſome Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Crown yet in force, which ties it ſtrictly to the next.</p>
                     <p>I come now to prove, That the People of <hi>England</hi> are actually diſcharged from their Oaths of Allegiance to <hi>J.</hi> 2. and were lately reſtor'd to that Latitude of Choice which I have ſhewn to be their Original Right.</p>
                     <p>The Lords and Commons having a Judicial Power in this matter, as hath been prov'd at large; their Exerciſe of this Power, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, determines the Right, unleſs an Appeal lies from them to ſome higher Court in this Nation: But that no Power can legally queſtion them or any of them in this matter, appears more particularly in that there is no Statute now in force, (nor was ſince the Death of <hi>Car.</hi> 2.) which makes it Treaſon to conſpire to Depoſe a King, or actually to Depoſe him.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Sir</hi> Rob.

Wherefore the Defence of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings might juſtly ſeem to be ſuperſeded, were it not for an ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable ſort of men, who either cannot, or will not judg according to the Rules of Right Reaſoning; but as they will hardly admit of any Doctrine as true, for which they have not the Deciſion of ſome Father or Council; will believe no Action, not proceeding from their imperious Dictates, juſtifiable even in Caſes of the utmoſt neceſſity, for the preſervation of the true Religion and juſt Laws, for which they have no warrant from the Examples of their Forefathers, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Men, whoſe Books have paſt with their Allowance: Which often drives me to the ſeeming Pedantry of Quotations, to confirm the moſt obvious Conſiderations to which my own thoughts led me.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>J.</hi> 2. had before his Departure, broken the Fundamental Laws, and that now he not only ceaſes to protect, but before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſs'd upon the Breach, was in a Kingdom which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtrengthens a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> part of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, I think no body will deny.

And ſince it has been made appear, That the Heirs of a King with us, take not as Purchaſers by an Original Contract, (upon which there might be ſome pretence of an Intereſt veſted in them, independent on their Father's Title); but they who can be ſaid to have ſucceeded without an immediate Choice, did it by virtue of ſubſequent Settlements, entirely depending upon the Original Contract, continuing down to their immediate Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors reſpectively; If that Contract be diſſolv'd, what can ſupport the Settlement? Can the Agreement for the benefit of a King and his Poſterity, be ſuppos'd to be other, than that if he govern them as King, performing the Eſſentials of the Contract on his part, he and his Deſcendants ſhall enjoy the Crown?

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, according to the Act of Recognition, 1 <hi>J.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">1 Jac. 1. c. 1.</note> the Crown came to him, being <hi>lineally, rightfully, and lawfully deſcended of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the moſt Excellent Lady</hi> Margaret, <hi>the eldeſt Daughter of the moſt Renowned King</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh, and the High and Noble Princeſs, Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>his Wife, eldeſt Daughter of King</hi> Edward <hi>the Fourth: The ſaid Lady</hi> Margaret <hi>being eldeſt Siſter of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth, Father of the High and Mighty Princeſs of Famous Memory,</hi> Elizabeth <hi>late Queen of</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>Thô this pompous Pedigree, to avoid all Objections, goes as high as <hi>E.</hi> 4. the Derivation of Title, as appears above, can be no higher than from the Settlement 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.

                        </note> And if we ſhould uſe Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s Authority,
<q>Impoſſible it is in Nature for Men to give a Law unto themſelves, no more than it is to command a Mans ſelf in a Matter depending of his own Will. There can be no Obligation which taketh State from the meer Will of him that promiſes the ſame.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, to apply this Rule: Since the People that is now,<note place="margin">Vid. Pufend. de Interregn. ſup. p. 288.289.</note> in common preſumption is the ſame with that which firſt ſettled the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and ſo are bound only by an Act of their own Will; they have yet as arbitrary a Power in this Matter, as Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers contend that the Prince has, whatever Promiſes or Agreements he has entred into.</p>
                     <p>But not to lean upon ſuch a broken Reed, nor yet to make thoſe many Inferences which this plain State of the Settlements of the Crown might afford; Three things I ſhall obſerve:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Settlement made 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. who was an Uſurper, according to the Notion of Dr. <hi>Brady,</hi> and his Set of Men, was of no force; then, there being no Remainders, ſince limited by any act, but what are ſpent, and no deſcendants of the whole Blood from <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to <hi>E.</hi> 4. and Wife to <hi>H.</hi> 7. but by Daughters, the eldeſt of which was Married into <hi>Scotland</hi>; If Acts of Settlement could not alter the Right of Deſcent of the Crown, neither <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> nor <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> had Right, but after the death of <hi>E.</hi> 6. it belonged to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Family. And if Acts of Settlement could diſpoſe of the Crown, and it ſhould appear that from the time that the limitation came to a Foreigner not nam'd in the Settlement, nor the immediate iſſue of a King or Queen of <hi>England,</hi> it was ſpent in the eye of the Law; then of neceſſity the People muſt have had Power of Chuſing, or there could have been no lawful Government ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, when the laſt Settlement was ſpent, except what is now made.</p>

The Declarations of two Parliaments, 28 and 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. fully ballance the Declaration 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. if they do not turn the Scales; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that the Judges in the later Times ſeem to have had leſs Law or Integrity than they had in <hi>H.</hi> the Eighth's. I will not take upon me to determine which was the Point of Two that they might go upon. 1. That a Government ſhall not paſs by Implication, or by reaſon of a dormant Remainder. But there having been ſo many Alterations ſince the Settlement 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and the whole Fee once diſpoſed of, nor ever any expreſs Reſtitution of the Settlement 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. the People were not to think themſelves obliged to a Retroſpect: 'Tis evident, at leaſt, that they did not. Or, 2. Perhaps they might queſtion, whether they were oblig'd to receive for Kings the Iſſue of Foreign Princes,<note place="margin">That this was a Queſtion in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, appears by a Letter from <hi>Lethington,</hi> Secretary of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Cecil,</hi> Secretary to Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to Vol. <hi>2.</hi> of the Hiſt. of the Ref. <hi>f. 269.</hi> This appears farther from the Treatiſe at the end of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, which ſeems to admit, That the Right to the Crown would have been in the iſſue of the younger Daughter, being born in <hi>England,</hi> if the Birth had been without blemiſh.</note> ſince there was no means of being ſufficiently inform'd of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Birth, neither the Common, or any Statute-Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording any Means of proving it, as appears by the Statute 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which for the Children of Subjects only, born out of the King's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, in Caſes wherein the Biſhop has Conuſance, allows of a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from the Biſhop of the Place where the Land in queſtion lies, if the Mother paſs'd the Seas by the King's Licenſe. But if our Kings or Queens ſhould upon any occaſion be in Foreign Parts, 'tis to be preſum'd, that they would have with them a Retinue ſubject to our Laws, who might atteſt the Birth of their Children, and be puniſh'd if they ſwear falſly.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The effect of the Diſſolution of the Contract. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Triennial-Act <hi>16 Car. 1.</hi> againſt the neceſſity of Common Form. The Form and proceedings of the Convention aſſembled upon the death of <hi>H. 3.</hi> The Dilemma uſed by the Formaliſts, Anſwer'd, with a Diſtinction. <hi>Pufendorf</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Hobbs.</hi> Another paſſage of his applied to a paſſage in a late excellent Treatiſe againſt Sir <hi>Robert Filmer:</hi> And to a Letter upon this Juncture. Tho what Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> ſays againſt the Rights of Lords and Commons, were true; yet it is ſhewn that the Acts of the late Aſſembly would be concluſive to the Nation. Neither Forty days Summons, nor Writs, nor yet Summons to a Parliament, Eſſential. And this confirmed, not only by the Preſident <hi>12 Car. 2.</hi> but by two Preſidents of the time of <hi>H. 1.</hi> The Subjects in the time of <hi>E. 1.</hi> ſaid to have held a Parliament by themſelves, and of their own appointing. The Objection of want of Form, Anſwered out of the Civil-Law; and its Reaſon applied to our Caſe. Objections made by the Author of <hi>Elementa Politica</hi> conſidered. The Concluſion.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Power, having upon the Diſſolution of the Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>J.</hi> 2. and his former Subjects, returned to the People of Legal Intereſts in the Government, according to the Conſtitution; there can be no doubt with unbiaſſed Men, but this takes in them only who have Right of being in Perſon, or by Repreſentation in thoſe Aſſemblies where is the higheſt Exerciſe of the Supream Power. But there are two Extreams oppoſite to the late Election made by ſuch an Aſſembly. The Firſt is of them who would have all things go on in the ſame Form as under a Monarch, which was impoſſible; and therefore the Supream-Law, the Publick-Safety, muſt needs ſupply the want of Form. Nor can be juſtly controverted, till the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the end is diſprov'd. For all Means neceſſary to ſuch an End, are allowable in Nature, and by all Laws. But if this ſhould ſtill be diſputed, all their Darling-Laws made by the Long-Parliament, which met after that Convention, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. will fall to the ground, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former application of the Statute above-mentioned, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Vid. Sup.</note> Nay, the attempt of Repealing that Statute, being in a Parliament which had been actually Diſſolved before, by that very Law which it went about to Repeal, that Form which was uſual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is, in default of King and Officers, ſupplied by another Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Regular Meeting of Lords and Commons. And what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but the people had as much Power to vary from the Common Form, when there was no King, and that Form could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, as when there was a King, and a poſſibility of having that Form?</p>
                     <p>Here I may obſerve theſe two things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If, as I have ſhewn at large, the Right of Succeſſion to the Crown, was not fixed to the next in Blood, neither before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> nor ſince; if there have been ſeveral <hi>vacancies</hi> of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44505:72"/>
                        <hi>Throne,</hi> and the People had right to chuſe upon every ſuch <hi>Vacancy,</hi> then whatever they did in order to the choice, muſt neceſſarily have been freed from the Forms which were required under a King.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Even where the Kingdom has gone by deſcent, there may have been a neceſſity for the people to take the Government upon them, as if the preſent Poſſeſſor has turned Madman, or he who ſtood next in the Succeſſion, were under age, without any Guardian appointed in the Life-time of his Father, or out of the land when his Father died, which were the caſes of <hi>R.</hi> 1. and of <hi>E.</hi> 1. the account of the laſt of which deſerves particular notice.

Clergy and People, as ſoon as might be, haſtned to the great Altar of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Church, ſwearing Fealty to <hi>Edward</hi> the King's eldeſt Son, tho they were wholly ignorant whether he were alive or no; for he was in Foreign Parts, fighting againſt the Enemies of Chriſt. After this the Nobility of the Kingdom likewiſe met; and a new Seal being made, they conſtituted faithful Miniſters and <hi>Keepers,</hi> who might faithfully keep the King's Treaſure, and the Peace of the Kingdom.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Matthew Weſtminſter</hi> differ in circumſtances, tho they agree in ſubſtance; but it would ſeem as if the ſame <hi>Convention</hi> had been adjourn'd from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and therefore its Acts might have been ſaid to have been at either of the places.</p>
                     <p>It at leaſt appears from <hi>Matthew Weſtminſter,</hi> that prior to that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Convention</hi> which the <hi>Annals</hi> mention, there had been a great confluence of people headed by the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Waren</hi>; at that meeting 'tis probable that the three perſons nam'd in the Annals were choſen to hold the <hi>Convention</hi> as Vicegerents to the King. This when it met, provided not only for ſwearing Allegiance to the King, but for the adminiſtration of Juſtice, choſe the great Officers of the Kingdom, made a new Great Seal, and if occaſion had been, might have raiſed a Tax over the whole Kingdom, as well as they did of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or permitted their Repreſentatives to raiſe of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>This Convention was not ſo full and ſolemn a Repreſentative of the People as ours was, and yet it being a Repreſentation which the People conſented to at that time, was then look'd on as ſufficient to conclude the whole, and is a Preſident in Point, ſhewing that there was no neceſſity, in ſuch circumſtances, to uſe the ſame form of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as when they had a King before whom they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned. But as the men of Form are too ſtrict, others are too looſe in their notions, and ſuppoſe the Conſequence of a <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of this <hi>Contract</hi> to be a mere <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or abſolute <hi>Anarchy,</hi> wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body has an equal ſhare in the Government, not only Landed-men, and others with whom the Ballance of the Power has reſted by the Conſtitution, but Copy-holders, Servants, and the very <hi>Faeces Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> which would not only make a quiet Election impracticable, but bring in a deplorable Confuſion. But this <hi>Dilemma</hi> they think not to be anſwer'd:</p>

                        <hi>he who has the Supreme executive Power, neglects and abandons that charge, ſo that the Laws already made, can no longer be put in execution: This is demonſtratively to reduce all to Anarchy, and ſo effectually to diſſolve the Government; for Laws not being made for themſelves, but to be by their execution the bonds of the Society, to keep every part of the Body-Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in its due place and function, when that totally ceaſes, the Government viſibly ceaſes, and the people become a confuſed multitude, without Order or Connexion: Where there is no longer the Adminiſtration of Juſtice for the ſecuring of mens Rights, nor any remaining Power within the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to direct the form, or provide for the neceſſities of the Publick, there certainly is no Government left.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in whatever Community there is a Power remaining to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the neceſſities of the Publick, upon the determination of the Intereſt of any ſingle Perſon, who had the <hi>Supreme Executive Power,</hi> without recourſe to the <hi>confus'd Multitude</hi>; there 'tis evident the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may ſtill continue: and by conſequence, ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more perfect, being leſs ſubject to diſſolution, than that which upon the loſs of its Supreme Governour has all its Bonds and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments diſſolv'd.</p>
                     <p>However, this his Scheme of Government is not erected as the moſt perfect, but ſeems deſignedly adapted to what he takes our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be, tho not expreſly named; in which he ſuppoſes <hi>a ſingle he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Perſon, having the conſtant Supreme Executive Power,</hi>

<q>If this may be done with certain knowledg that he was a Servant, much more through miſtake; for if the People, who have the Supream Power, may with certain knowledg, for the ſake of the Publick-Good, not only deſign a Servant for <hi>Praetor,</hi> but in this Caſe, by a juſt Election, take a Servant away from his Maſter; How much more may it be done as in the Caſe propounded, not to make a Servant wholly a true <hi>Praetor,</hi> not to take him from his Maſter; but only by a commodious interpretation, to have what is done by him, or with him, ſuſtain'd; and that ſo long, the Error of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Servitude of the Perſon choſen, ſhould not prejudice what is done?</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>And if ever the Common Utility, or Publick Good, might warrant Actions out of the Common Courſe, certainly this could never have been pleaded more forcibly than in the Caſe of this Nation; which unleſs it had declared for King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY</hi> (which they did in the moſt regular way that the Nature of the thing would bear) had in all likelyhood, by <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Forces, by this time been reduc'd to the miſerable condition of the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are by no means beholden to the nice Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of unneceſſary and impracticable Forms.</p>

                     <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                     <p>I Cannot think that I have followed Truth too nigh at the heels for my Safety in the preſent Government, which I take to be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſtaple Foundation; and that Proteſtant fondly flatters himſelf, who thinks to retain his Religion and Security upon any Terms, at a return of the Former, which ſome who were Inſtruments in ſetting up this, ſeem madly to contend for. But could men hope to find their private Accounts in ſuch a Change, yet ſurely the diſmal Proſpect of Common Calamities to enſue, ſhould induce them to ſacrifice ſuch low Ends, to the Intereſt of their Religion and their Country.</p>
                     <p>I am not ſenſible that I have miſrepreſented any Fact or Authority, tho I have not urg'd them with that ſtrength, which might have been by a better Pen. Perhaps what I have offer'd may give another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Succeſſion, than what many have imbib'd, who will think I violate what is ſacred. I have not urg'd the Illegitimation of the Children of <hi>E.</hi> 4. by <hi>Richard</hi> the Third's Parliament; becauſe, tho he was a King <hi>de facto,</hi> if the Character fix'd on him be true, he was a Tyrant as well as Uſurper upon the Innocent Prince <hi>E.</hi> 5. in whoſe Name he firſt took the Government upon him, and either terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or cheated the People into a Compliance with his Pretences.</p>
                     <p>Tho I have not the vanity to believe, that any thing of my own can weigh with them who have thought otherwiſe before; eſpecially if they have liſted themſelves on a Side contrary to that, which no Diſadvantages can make me repent of: Yet I cannot but hope that the Authorities which I have produc'd, will occaſion ſome conſideration, till they are either evaded or diſprov'd. And being all legal <hi>Objections</hi> are anſwered; nor can any ſcruple of Conſcience be here pretended, without, much leſs againſt Law; What hinders, but that we ſhould exert our utmoſt in the Service of that Lawful Government, from which we receive Protection, and may expect Rewards for vertue, at leaſt the Defence of it, if we do not madly quit the ground which we have gain'd from them, who have hitherto made Vertue the greateſt Crime?</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, for us now to look back, after we have ſet our hands to the Plow, would be not only to diſtruſt that Providence which has given ſuch a wonderful Encouragement to Perſeverance; but were enough to tarniſh all our Actions, with the Imputation of making the publick Intereſt a Pretence for carrying on our own. 'Tis an happineſs indeed when they are twiſted and thrive together. But the Cauſe is ſuch, as a man ought not to fear to dye, nay to ſtarve for it. And how improſperous ſoever a man's endeavours for this, may prove, yet it may be a comfort to have ſown that Seed, which may grow up for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of future Ages. Nor ought he to repine, becauſe another man hath guilded over his Name by what he has got by the ruin of his Country, or may have inſinuated himſelf again into Opportunities to betray it: Let it be enough for him, how much ſoever ſlighted and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44505:80"/>
contemn'd while he lives, to embalm his Memory, by a ſteddineſs to Truth, and the Intereſt of his Country; not to be ſhaken by croſs accidents to himſelf, or the Publick Cauſe. Let him ſtill act uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while others live in perpetual Contradictions or Varieties; their Actions and their Principles thwarting themſelves, or each other, or varying with the State-weathercocks. Let them violate the Laws out of Loyalty; unchurch all Proteſtant Churches, but their own, out of Zeal againſt Popery; narrow the Terms of Communion, to ſpread the National Religion; confine all advantages to that Communion, for the Publick Good; make their King the Head of a Party, to ſtrengthen his hands againſt his Enemies; Deliver up Charters, and Retake them, gelt of their Nobleſt Priviledges, in performance of their Oaths to preſerve them; fight againſt their King, and yet urge the Obligation of Oaths requiring an unalterable Allegiance to his Perſon; aſſert that the Power is inſeparable from him, and yet may in his Abſence, without his Conſent, be transferr'd to a Regent, not to be Reaſſumed when he ſhould think fit to return; grant that he has broken the Contract, yet contend that he retains that Power, which he received from the Contract: Or that tho the Contract be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Throne is not vacant: Or if it be vacant, yet an Heir has a Right; and ſo it is vacant, and not vacant at the ſame time: Or that after one has broken a Condition, upon which he took an Eſtate to himſelf and his Heirs in Fee-Simple or Tail, another ſhall enjoy it as Heir to him, and that in his Life-time; invite a Deliverer, yet reject the Deliverance.</p>
                     <p>Upon ſuch Principles as theſe, I find an Eminent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelate cenſur'd as a Deſerter of his Church, for going about,<note place="margin">Letter to the <hi>B.</hi> of L.</note> according to his great Learning, to juſtifie the Oaths taken to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And thus the Cauſe of <hi>J.</hi> 2. is made the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Certain it is, whatever is now pretended, 'tis more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to juſtifie the taking up, or promoting Arms againſt a Deliverer, than an Oppreſſor. And if Arms againſt the laſt were lawful, even with the proſpect of involving Thouſands in the Miſeries of War; much more are they, in Defence of that Power which has reſtor'd thoſe Liberties, which the other Invaded, and reaſſured the Publick Peace. And whoever firſt engaged, and now draw back, not only brand themſelves for Traitors, but make it evident, that Ambition, Revenge, or ſome ungenerous Deſign, animated their Undertakings. And as I doubt not but they will meet with their due Reward; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that Succeſs which has attended the Heroical Actions of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King, may go further with ſuch men, to keep them to their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the moſt demonſtrative Proofs of Right, which they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally meaſure by the Event. And as no Cauſe or Action is juſt in their eyes, which is not proſperous; they in the language of the Poet are always on the ſide of the gods: But few are in this Point ſuch Philoſophers as <hi>Cato.</hi>

                     <p>Now, in ſhort, here lies the Subſtance of theſe Principles, the Danger of the improvement of which was happily prevented by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign.</p>
                     <p>The Power of the Keys, or Church-Power, is only Authority to preach the Goſpel, that was equally given to all the Apoſtles; therefore all Apoſtles had equally the Power of the Keys, and ſo were equal: And by conſequence will ſome ſay, all Preachers after them, that had only a general and ordinary Commiſſion to preach, are equal, of the ſame Order to one another, Order being taken for a Power to do a ſpecial Act, as the Learned Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> informs us;<note place="margin">Ep. Wynton. Reſp. ad 3 Ep. Pet. Moline. p. 192.</note> 
                        <hi>Ordinem eſſe poteſtatem ad actum ſpecialem, non à me dico, Schola hoc dicit tota.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Even the Authority to preach the Goſpel, which was in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner committed to the Apoſtles, and by Ordination by them practiſed, conferr'd upon others, and always continued in the Church, ſome great Church-men will tell us ought to yield to the Civil Power ſo far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no Man forbidden by the Magiſtrate ought to preach, without an immediate Commiſſion from Heaven, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles. Whereas others will ſay, 'twas enough that the Power was given at firſt, and atteſted to by Miracles. Something agreeably to which, a Learned Church-man ſays, <hi>Touching the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Since the Divine Eſtabliſhment of the Publick Chriſtian Service is contained in the Goſpel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Falkner<hi>'s Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Loyalty,</hi> p. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>no Authority upon Earth hath any right to prohibit this: And thoſe Chriſtians that rightly worſhip God, in the true Catholick Communion, according to the Apoſtolical and Primitive Church, have a right to hold ſuch Aſſemblies for the Chriſtian Worſhip, as appear uſeful for the Church's Good, tho this ſhould be againſt the Interdict of the Civil Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is greatly oppoſite to the Judgment ſince deliver'd in the Caſe; yet by adding falſe Terms, he enervates his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; for his Argument is taken from ſuch Service its being contain'd in Scripture; but upon that he would ſupport thoſe Modes of Worſhip, which though not contain'd in Scripture, were us'd in the Primitive Church, which is an <hi>Individium vagum,</hi> which ſome confine to the Life-time of the Apoſtles, ſome extend to the whole firſt three Centuries, ſome even to this, according to the Doctrine of Infallible Tradition. Suppoſe, for Example, that in ſuch Aſſemblies as are form'd with or without leave of the Civil Power, the Sign of the Croſs be uſed as a Symbol of dedicating to the Service of Chriſt, thoſe who are let into <hi>Catholick Communion</hi>; and this they judg uſeful to the preſent, and according to the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church,</hi> it will be a Queſtion, Whether the retaining of this, againſt a particular Interdict of the Civil Power, (which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable at leaſt) is to be juſtifi'd upon theſe Grounds? Put this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Form, and you will find he has more or leſs in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, than in his Premiſes. Rightly taken, I conceive it lies thus:</p>
                     <p>If the Goſpel contains a Divine Eſtabliſhment of Publick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Service; ſuch Publick Chriſtian Service as has therein Divine Eſtabliſhment, no Authority upon Earth hath any right to prohibit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44505:83"/>But the Goſpel does contain a Divine Eſtabliſhment of Publick Chriſtian Service: Therefore ſuch Publick Chriſtian Service as has therein Divine Eſtabliſhment, no Authority upon Earth has Power to prohibit.</p>
                     <p>This being taken for granted, he proceeds; What no Authority upon Earth has right to prohibit, may be done or perform'd not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Interdict of the Civil Power.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch Service, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> no Authority upon Earth hath right to prohibit, therefore it may be perform'd notwithſtanding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict of the Civil Power.</p>
                     <p>But he concludes contrary to the Laws of Arguing; <hi>That thoſe Chriſtians who rightly worſhip God in the True Catholick Communion, according to the Apoſtolical and Primitive Church, have a right to hold ſuch Aſſemblies for the Chriſtian Worſhip, as appear uſeful for the Church's Good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if hereby he means that they who worſhip God according to the Scriptures, even though taking in the Practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, have not this Right, unleſs they do it in the manner us'd till, or at the end of the firſt three hundred Years after Chriſt, which is the modeſteſt acceptation of Primitive Times. Here, by adding of Circumſtances, his Concluſion has really leſs than the Premiſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ties up them whom the Scripture has left free, and takes from the Authority of Scripture where the Foundation was laid, and undermines it by going to ſupport it with the ſpecious words of <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>Primitive,</hi> which ſtill are of doubtful Acceptation. Whereas ſome believe that no manner of Worſhip is to be term'd <hi>Primitive,</hi> which was not truly Apoſtolical, that is, us'd by the Apoſtles themſelves, others call every thing within thoſe three Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies at leaſt, <hi>Primitive,</hi> and therefore Apoſtolical.</p>
                     <p>But to be ſure here is a very falſe way of Arguing, if he uſes any, or elſe 'tis <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> But take it for an Argument, and then to his purpoſe, there is more in the Concluſion than in the Premiſes; for the Premiſes are only of ſuch Publick Service as is contain'd and eſtabliſh'd in the Goſpel; and thence he would conclude, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been practis'd in the Primitive Church, in the Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, may be continued notwithſtanding the Interdict. Nay, he would go farther, That they may in their Aſſemblies practiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Judgment, of <hi>what is uſeful for the Church's Good.</hi> If it be ſaid, that he means no more, than that they may hold ſuch Aſſemblies for Chriſtian Worſhip as appear uſeful, that is, <hi>of Five beſides a ſingle Family,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">22 Car. 2. c. 1.</note> or more, as appears uſeful, if he means not that they may aſſemble, and worſhip, in ſuch a manner as appears uſeful, he excludes the Worſhip out of the Aſſembly, and then it may be a Silent Meeting if the Civil Power pleaſe, and is leſs than his Premiſes warrant.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs, he ſeems to intend the amuſing, rather than ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Readers, by putting in <hi>the true Catholick Communion</hi>; for he muſt mean either that what-ever Publick Service is according to the Apoſtolical and Primitive Church, is in <hi>true Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and ſo <hi>vice verſa,</hi> that what-ever is in <hi>true Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> is according to the Apoſtolical and Primitive Church; ſo that the Church becomes the Rule to the ſupplanting of Scripture: or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44505:83"/>
elſe, that to worſhip God rightly and warrantably, notwithſtanding a Civil Interdict, 'tis not enough to be according to the Apoſtolical and Primitive Church, unleſs it be in the true Catholick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is, with ſuch Terms of Communion as Chriſt himſelf, or his Apoſtles made Catholick and univerſally obliging; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this ſenſe, though he has not obſerv'd it, he comes up fully to the Force of his Argument.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> whoſe Judgment, where it was according to that <hi>lumen ſiccum,</hi> the general want of which is to be deplored, is of great Authority, has gone about to ſplit the Hair between two Extreams, in relation to Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and lays down what he ſays is moſt conſentaneous to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and moreover to the Laws of the Kingdom;<note place="margin">

                     <p>Now his Notion is, that the <hi>jus condendi Leges Eccleſiaſticas,</hi> that is, the Legiſlative Power in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, is in the Biſhops, Presbyters, and other Perſons duly elected by the Clergy of the whole Kingdom, and duly aſſembled in a lawful Synod.</p>

                     <p>The chief Act of Government, requires the chief or Supream Power.</p>

                     <p>So that Uſurpation is the unjuſt taking away, or diſpoſſeſſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Power, and for it to be unjuſt, it muſt be the Act of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt a Lawful Prince, wherefore none but a Rebel can uſurp; this Man, by continuance of his Injuſtice, can never gain a Title.

And it is not improper to ſay, that in obeying an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, we may obey pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily the true Superiour, ſo long as our Obedience aims at the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe in ſubjection, and not at the Deſtruction of the true Governour.</hi>

                        <hi>that in the time of</hi> Abraham, <hi>which was about</hi> 300 <hi>Years after the Flood, in a little Corner of</hi> Aſia, <hi>five Kings at once met in Battel, moſt of which were but Kings of Cities a-piece,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We muſt conclude, that theſe were but ſome petty Lords under One great King.</hi>

                        <hi>nor determin'd what part of a People ſhall belong to one Kingdom, and what to another, it follows that the Original Freedom of Mankind being ſuppos'd, every Man is at liberty to be of what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he pleaſes; and ſo every petty Company hath a right to make a Kingdom by it ſelf; and not only every City, but every Village, and every Family, nay, and every particular Man, a liberty to chuſe himſelf to be his own King if he pleaſe; and he were a Mad-man, that being by Nature free, would chuſe any Man but himſelf to be his own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. Thus to avoid the having but of one King of the whole World, we ſhall run into a liberty of having as many Kings as there are Men in the World.</hi>

                     <p>His Argument, if he makes any, is this. If Mankind were free by Nature, there would be as many Kings as there are Men in the World; but they are not free, Therefore there is but One King of the whole World; nor can it ever be otherwiſe;<note place="margin">Anarchy, <hi>p.</hi> 266</note> 
                        <hi>For the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Power of</hi> Adam <hi>the Father of all Fleſh, was by a general bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance ſettled by God, in him and his Poſterity, by Right of Fatherhood.</hi> Wherefore being ſettled on the Poſterity, it muſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, deſcend to the Eldeſt; and could not be otherwiſe diſpos'd of by <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, (ſo that his Grant or Permiſſion, or anothers Conqueſt, would be invalid.<note place="margin">Patriarcha, <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note>) for <hi>ſuch Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but alſo of their Brethren, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were ſubject to their Fathers; and therefore we find that God told</hi> Cain <hi>of his brother</hi> Abel, <hi>His deſires ſhall be ſubject to thee, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> tells us, That <hi>all Kings that now are, or ever were,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anarchy, <hi>p.</hi> 273.</note> 
                        <hi>are or were, either Fathers of their People, or the Heirs of ſuch Fathers, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of the Right of ſuch Fathers.</hi> All it ſeems are with Title, and yet in the very next Lines, he ſays in effect, That none have Title but one at a time, and that is only the next Heir from <hi>Adam,</hi> unleſs <hi>Adam</hi> can have ſeveral Heirs at the ſame time to his univerſal Monarchy. Which, <hi>ſince Nature hath not diſtinguiſh'd the habitable World into Kingdoms,</hi> is to make ſeveral Monarchs within the ſame Community. I would fain know how it can be ſhewn, upon Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s grounds, that the ſeveral Polities in diſtinct Kingdoms were lawfully erected, ſince they ought all to be dependent upon One, if he be in the Right: nor can they preſcribe to a Diviſion;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44505:88"/>
for there can be no Preſcription againſt the Right of the Univerſal Heir. If Uſurpation acquires a Right, poſſibly the Great Turk ſtands faireſt for it at this Day; and having gotten ſo much natural Power, all Princes not equal in Strength, ought to yield him their Crowns upon his Summons.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Patriar. <hi>p.</hi> 45.</note>But this cannot prejudice the Right of the True Heir, though <hi>it may hinder him in the uſe or exerciſe of his natural Rights, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no Man loſeth the Right it ſelf.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That is in effect, If there were but one Multitude in the World, all would be under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heir, as a natural Head; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral, the ſtate of the Queſtion is altered, nay, and that by <hi>Divine Right</hi> too, for the Scripture ſays, <hi>God hath determined the Bounds of their Habitation,</hi> Acts 17.26. But admit <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heir who has Right to be King, reſides with any particular multitude, the Right cannot be in him and in another at the ſame time; and therefore no other Title but that of a natural deſcent from <hi>Adam</hi> can be good.</p>
                     <p>He intimates as if no King could ever die without ſuch Heir as the People are bound to obey; nor by the ſame reaſon could <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, or they that claim in a natural deſcent from him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the true Heir to the firſt Monarch, and no other would have the Right.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Anarchy, <hi>p.</hi> 272</note>Yet he grants, That <hi>if a King could die without Heir, the Kingly Power in that caſe ſhall eſcheat to the Supream Heads and Fathers of Families</hi>;<note place="margin">Patriarc. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> or, as he explains it in his <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> Independent Heads, which he makes ſuch as are Heads adopted by <hi>Princes</hi>; but in effect grants more than any wiſe Man will contend for, <hi>viz,</hi> that it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheats to every Man within the Kingdom, Freeman and Servants; for that, by his Principles of Confuſion, Nobility, or adopted Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, depends upon the Grace of the Prince, having no Foundation in Nature; and that Grace with all its Effects, determines at the Death of the Prince;<note place="margin">

Wherefore Property, and all Diſtinctions not ſettled by God, or Nature, diſſolve, and then all Men are equal as to Diſtinctions brought in by Humane Laws.</p>
                     <p>This I ſuppoſe is to make way for the natural Headſhip of Fathers in a ſtrict ſenſe, and that he takes away too, and places it in the Nobility; and the Nobility expiring, what becomes of it? Why, 'tis <hi>in nubibus,</hi> in Abeyance, till they, who have no Right to do any Act of Power, part with the eſcheated Power by free Choice, or yielding to a Conquerour: ſpeaking of the Caſe, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of that One in the World, who is next Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> be loſt,</p>

to the Multitude, and that they have Power to Rule, and chuſe what Rulers they pleaſe. No, the Kingly Power eſcheats in ſuch Caſes to the Princes, and independent Heads of Families, and every Kingdom is reſolved into thoſe Parts whereof it at firſt was made, by the uniting of great Families, or petit Kingdoms, as we find the Great Monarchies were at firſt erected, and into ſuch again as into the firſt Matter many times they return. And becauſe the dependency of Ancient Families is oft obſcure, or worn out of knowledg; therefore the Wiſdom of all, or moſt Princes, hath thought fit to adopt many times thoſe for Heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Princes of Provinces, whoſe Merits, Abilities, or Fortunes have enabled them, or made fit or capable of ſuch Regal Favours. All ſuch prime Heads and Fathers, have Power to conſent in the uniting or transferring their Fatherly Right of Soveraign Authority on whom they pleaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis to be obſerved, that our worthy Knight never takes care for more than ſerving the preſent Occaſions; where he comes to ſhew, that the Houſe of Lords are not born Counſellors, nor can claim to be ſo, <hi>ex debito Juſtitiae,</hi> having no Right in Nature,<note place="margin">Vid. ſup. <hi>F.</hi> 14.</note> nor any Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority but what depends on the Grace of the Prince; and that, as his laſt Eſſay explains it, of the immediate Prince. It was neceſſary to claw the Commons, as ſtanding fair for the Pretence of being natural Counſellors, if they can make out their Repreſentation of the People to be full and compleat. But here when he talks of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent or Supream Heads, theſe were too big Epithets for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and therefore theſe muſt be Lords. Not conſidering that he makes them in another place ceaſe to be ſo, till their Dignity be reviv'd, which cannot be by themſelves;<note place="margin">Power of Kings, <hi>p. 1.</hi>
                        </note> but it muſt be <hi>ratified by the expreſs Conſent, or at leaſt by Sufferance of the Prince following who had knowledg thereof.</hi> The Reaſon of which he has given in another place,<note place="margin">Obſerv. touching Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>p. 149.</hi> Laſt Ed.</note> for <hi>every Law muſt always have ſome preſent known Perſon in being, whoſe Will it muſt be to make it a Law for the preſent.</hi>

                     <p>If the Independent Heads, or Nobles, are, inſtead of One Prince, to make choice of an Head, which is a Law to that end; then a Law may flow from the Will of many, as well as from that of One.</p>
                     <p>But take Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Notion of Supream or Independent Heads and Fathers, in the moſt ſenſible meaning, that is, of Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; theſe, where there is no diviſion into Tribes, as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews, will be numerous. Yet all, in the Caſe preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, are allow'd by Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> to be inveſted with Kingly Power; and therefore the parting with it muſt be by their choice, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf yields; and yet, according to his Principles, they can never ſo part with it, but they may reſume it.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs in this, he doubly contradicts himſelf; for the End of his Writings being to prove, that the Government ought always to be in One abſolutely, here he yields it to be in many. And when before he ſaid, That <hi>Civil Power, not only in general,</hi>

                     <p>But that every ſuch Parent as was at any time veſted with this Power, may reſume it, is the plain Inference from his Doctrine; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44505:89"/>
he tells us,<note place="margin">Patriar. <hi>p.</hi> 54.</note> That <hi>although a King do frame all his Actions to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws, yet he is not bound thereto, but at his good Will, and for good Example;</hi>

Upon which Grounds the anſwer to his Queſtion is obvious; which is, that the Subjection due by Nature from Children to their Parents, is not defeated by the Kingly Power's being in One; and therefore <hi>the Power of the Father over his Child, does not give place to the Power of the Magiſtrate.</hi> If it did, this their natural Right the Parents may reſume, when 'tis for the Good of their reſpective Families, or thought ſo by them, and indeed of one great Family, they might reſolve the Community into as many ſeparate Governments, as there are Families, or <hi>Patres Familiâs,</hi> at their Pleaſures, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obligation to the contrary. If the Power whereby a Nation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44505:89"/>
is govern'd, were not wholly diſtinct from that whereby a private Family is; and if both came by Nature, ſince the true deſcent in Nature cannot now be made out, for every Family to make a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by its ſelf, muſt be moſt natural, and the only lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs Choice, that is, Humane Ordinance, may warrantably cement them into one Government. And this is very evident in the Caſe of Eſcheat, and of any Tranſlation of Kingly Power from Natural Fathers: For the Kingly Power is in the Fathers before the transferring it over, <hi>quatenus</hi> Fathers, or it is not. If it be in them, <hi>quatenus</hi> Fathers, then, according to Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> they may reſume whatever is eſſential to the Soveraignty of Fathers, being it was once lawfully veſted in them, at leaſt they have a great deal of Latitude for their Claim, becauſe,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>impoſſible it is in Nature, for to give a Law unto themſelves, no more than it is to command a Mans ſelf in a Matter depending of his own Will, there can be no Obligation which taketh ſtate from the meer Will of him that promiſeth the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus there can be no laſting Obligation at all; for he tells us, in effect, that if there be any Circumſtance which makes it not wholly ſpontaneous, 'tis voidable.</p>
                     <p>But if this Power was not veſted in them as Fathers, then it comes not to him who has the Kingly Power as a Fatherly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but meerly as Kingly, contradiſtinct from, and ſuperior to the Fatherly.</p>
                     <p>But how can the Supream Fathers, Nobles, or Free-holders transfer their Power? According to Sir <hi>R. F.</hi> it cannot be done in Nature, except every One, not the major part only, conſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As to the Acts of the major part of a Multitude, it is true,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that by politick humane Conſtitutions it is oft ordained, that the Voices of the moſt ſhall over-rule the reſt; and ſuch Ordinances bind, becauſe where Men are aſſembled by an Humane Power, that Power that doth aſſemble them, can alſo limit and direct the manner of the execution of that Power, and by ſuch derivative Power made known by Law, or Cuſtom, either the greater Part, or two Thirds, or three parts of Five, or the like, have Power to overſway the Liberty of their Oppoſits. But in Aſſemblies that take their Authority from the Law of Nature, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo; for what Freedom or Liberty is due to any Man by the Law of Nature, no inferior Power can alter, limit, or diminiſh.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The major part cannot in nature bind the reſt.</note> 
                        <hi>No one Man, or a Multitude, can give away the natural Right of another. The Law of Nature is unchangeable, and howſoever one Man may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44505:90"/>
another in the uſe or exerciſe of his natural Right, yet thereby no Man loſeth the Right its ſelf. For the Right, and the uſe of the Right, may be diſtinguiſhed; as Right, and Poſſeſſion are oft diſtinct. Therefore unleſs it can be proved, by the Law of Nature, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, or ſome other part, have Power to over-rule the reſt of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; It muſt follow that the Acts of Multitudes not entire, are not binding to all, but only to ſuch as conſent unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereby it appears, that it being taken for granted, that the major part, have not by the Law of Nature, Power to over-rule the reſt, it muſt follow, that where Power is veſted in ſeveral as Independent Fathers, this can never be parted with without the joint Conſent of every ſuch Father. But they muſt always be in <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> his State of War, till all the Diſſenters are reduc'd. And when ever they have natural Power, that is, ſtrength enough, they may try for it again, there being no moral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to the contrary. For, what ever terms they ſubmitted to by <hi>Deceit, Fraud, Error, Force, juſt Fear, or ſome great hurt</hi>; If they diminiſh that Majeſty which was once in them, they may vacate the Conditions at pleaſure. And what then becomes of all Title by Conqueſt?</p>
                     <p>To ſhew wherein Sir <hi>R.</hi> has deceiv'd himſelf and others, would be ſuperfluous to the judiciouſly Learned, and thrown away upon them that are not ſo. But I conceive that the meaneſt Capacity may by this be ſatisfi'd, that he is guilty of many Abſurdities, and ill Aſſertions. I muſt needs ſay, by thoſe ſtrong Stroaks which in many places occur, I conclude that he was far from being deceiv'd himſelf; for he was Maſter of more Reaſon; but poſſibly he practis'd upon the vulgar Underſtandings, to try how eaſily he could make them ſwallow Contradictions. If it was not with this End, I am ſure it was with a worſe, to looſen the Bonds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make way for real <hi>Anarchy</hi>; ſince he attempts to weaken all other Foundations of it but his own, and yet takes away even that too. I may reaſonably hope, that for the future, no Man will juſtify him, unleſs he firſt ſhew his Principles to be conſiſtent with themſelves, and with the right of our preſent Monarchs, few of which will inſiſt upon being natural Fathers of their People, or Heirs of ſuch Fathers, or Uſurpers of the Right of ſuch Fathers, and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> acquaints us with no other Title.</p>
                     <p>The natural intendment, at leaſt the conſequence of all his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is, when rightly conſider'd, to encourage Rebellion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne Lawful Kings, upon pretence of natural Right, and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Power; to degrade the Eccleſiaſtical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Peers, and herd them amongſt the Commons, upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,<note place="margin">Free-holders Grand-Inqueſt, <hi>p. 38.</hi>
                        </note> that the Power of the Houſe of Commons may <hi>be founded on the Principles of Nature: But that the Houſe of Peers do not, nor cannot make any ſuch pretence, ſince,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>there is no reaſon in Nature, why amongſt a company of Men who are all equal, ſome few ſhould be pluck'd out to be exalted above their Fellows, and have Power to govern thoſe who by Nature are their Companions.

                        <p n="1">I. THat the formality of the King's Writ of Summons is not ſo eſſential to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, but that the Peers of the Realm, and the Commons, by their Repreſentatives duly Elected, may legally Act as the great Council and Repreſentative Body of the Nation, though not ſummon'd by the King, eſpecially when the Circumſtances of the time are ſuch, that ſuch Summons cannot be had, will (I hope) appear by theſe following Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Saxon</hi> Government was tranſplanted hither out of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the meeting of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in ſuch Aſſemblies was at certain fixed times; <hi>viz.</hi> at the New and Full Moon. But after their Tranſmigration hither, Religion changing, other things changed with it; and the Times for their publick Aſſemblies, in conformity to the great Solemnity celebrated by Chriſtians, came to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter, Pentecoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Nativity.</hi> The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we come down in Story, the ſeldomer we find theſe General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to have been held; and ſometimes (even very anciently) when upon extraordinary Occaſions, they met out of courſe, a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> an <hi>Edict,</hi> or <hi>Sanction</hi> is mentioned to have iſſued from the King: But the Times, and the very Place of their ordinary Meeting having been certain, and determined in the very firſt and eldeſt Times that we meet with any mention of ſuch Aſſemblies, which times are as ancient as any Memory of the Nation it ſelf; hence I inferr, that no Summons from the King can be thought to have been neceſſary in thoſe days, becauſe it was altogether needleſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Succeſſion to the Crown did not in thoſe days, nor till of late Years, run in a courſe of Lineal Succeſſion by right of Inheritance: But upon the Death of a Prince, thoſe Perſons of the Realm that Compoſed the then Parliament, Aſſembled in order to the chooſing of another. That the Kingdom was then Elective, though one or other of the Royal Blood was always choſen, but the next in Lineal Succeſſion very ſeldom, is evident from the Genealogies of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, from an old Law made at <hi>Calchuyth,</hi> appointing how, and by whom Kings ſhall be choſen; and from many expreſs and particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given by our old Hiſtorians, of ſuch Aſſemblies held for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of Kings. Now ſuch Aſſemblies could not be Summon'd by any King; and yet in conjunction with the King that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44505:98"/>
ſet up, they made Laws, binding the King and all the Realm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After the Death of King <hi>William Rufus, Robert,</hi> his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, being then in the <hi>Holy Land, Henry,</hi> the youngeſt Son of King <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, procur'd an Aſſembly of the Clergy and People of <hi>England,</hi> to whom he made large promiſes of his good Government, in caſe they would accept of him for their King; and they agreeing, That if he would reſtore to them the Laws of King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> then they would conſent to make him their King. He ſwore that he would do ſo, and alſo free them from ſome Oppreſſions, which the Nation had groan'd under in his Brothers and his Fathers time. Hereupon they choſe him King, and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> ſet the Crown upon his Head: Which being done, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties paſs'd the Royal Aſſent in that Aſſembly, the ſame in ſubſtance, though not ſo large as King <hi>John</hi>'s, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's <hi>Magna Charta</hi>'s afterwards were.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After that King's Death, in ſuch another Parliament, King <hi>Stephen</hi> was Elected, and <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empreſs put by, though not without ſome ſtain of perfidiouſneſs upon all thoſe, and <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf eſpecially, who had ſworn in her Father Life-time, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg her for their Sovereign after his deceaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt's time, the King being abſent in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> then his Chancellor, being Regent of the Kingdom in his Abſence, whoſe Government was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to the People for his Inſolence and manifold Oppreſſions, a Parliament was convened at <hi>London,</hi> at the Inſtance of Earl <hi>John,</hi> the King's Brother, to treat of the great and weighty Affairs of the King and Kingdom; in which Parliament this ſame Regent was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd from his Government, and another ſet up, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Roan</hi> in his ſtead. This Aſſembly was not conven'd by the King, who was then in <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> nor by any Authority deriv'd from him, for then the Regent and Chancellor muſt have call'd them together; but they met, as the Hiſtorian ſays expreſly, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Earl <hi>John.</hi> And yet, in the King's Abſence, they took upon them to ſettle the publick Affairs of the Nation without Him.</p>

                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> died, his Eldeſt Son, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> was then in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and came not Home till within the third Year of his Reign; yet, immediately upon the Father's Death, all the Prelates and Nobles, and four Knights for every Shire, and four Burgeſſes for every Borough, Aſſembled together in a great Council, and ſetled the Government till the King ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: Made a new Seal, and a Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I inferr from what has been ſaid, that Writs of Summons are not ſo Eſſential to the being of Parliaments, but that the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

eſpecially at a time when they cannot be had, may by Law, and according to our Old Conſtitution, Aſſemble together in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way without them, to treat of and ſettle the Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Nation. And that, if ſuch Aſſemblies ſo conven'd, find the Throne Vacant, they may proceed not only to ſet up a Prince, but with the Aſſent and Concurrence of ſuch Prince, to tranſact all Publick Buſineſs whatſoever, without a new Election; they having as great Authority as the People of <hi>England</hi> can dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to their Repreſantatives.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Acts of Parliaments not Formal nor Legal in all their Circumſtances, are yet binding to the Nation ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Force, and not liable to be queſtioned as to the Validity of them, but in ſubſequent Parliaments.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> The two <hi>Spencers, Temp. Edvardi Secundi,</hi> were baniſhed by Act of Parliament, and that Act of Parliament repealed by <hi>Dures &amp; Force</hi>; yet was the Act of Repeal a good Law, till it was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Statutes of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and Attainders thereupon, were Repealed in a Parliament held, <hi>Ann.</hi> 21. of that King, which Parliament was procur'd by forc'd Elections; and yet the Repeal ſtood good, till ſuch time as in 1 <hi>Henry</hi> 4. the Statutes of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. were revived, and appointed to be firmly held and kept.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Parliament of 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. conſiſted of the ſame Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes that had ſerved in the then laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Parliament, and thoſe Perſons were by the King's Writs to the Sheriffs commanded to be returned, and yet they paſſed Acts, and their Acts though never confirmed, continue to be Laws at this day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Parliament that reſtored the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, was notoriouſly known to be pack'd, inſomuch that it was debated in Queeen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, whether or no to declare all their Acts void by Act of Parliament. That courſe was then upon ſome prudential Conſiderations declined; and therefore the Acts of that Parliament, not ſince repealed, continue binding Laws to this day.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of all this, is, Becauſe no inferiour Courts have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to judge of the Validity or Invalidity of the Acts of ſuch Aſſemblies, as have but ſo much as a colour of Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                        <p>The Acts of ſuch Aſſemblies being Entred upon the Parliament-Roll, and certified before the Judges of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> as Acts of Parliament, are concluſive and binding to them; becauſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the only Judges of the Imperfections, Invalidities, Illegali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of one another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44505:99"/>The Parliament that call'd in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, was not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by the King's Writ, and yet they made Acts, and the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſent was had to them; many of which indeed were afterwards confirmed, but not all, and thoſe that had no Confirmation, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Acts of Parliament without it, and have ever ſince obtained as ſuch.</p>
                        <p>Hence I Infer that the preſent Convention, may, if they pleaſe, aſſume to themſelves a Parliamentary Power, and in conjunction with ſuch King or Queen as they ſhall declare, may give Laws to the Kingdom as a legal Parliament.</p>

                  <p>And after of theyr Force or Intereſt by the Wyll.</p>
                  <p>Touchinge the Firſt. It is notorious and well inough knowne, that when <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suff.</hi> maryed with the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the Frenche Q. that he had then an other Wyfe lyvinge, which was the Lady <hi>Margaret Mortimer,</hi> with whome after mariage he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved dyvers yeres as lawfull Man and Wyfe: and after upon certayn diſcorde betweene theim, of his owne motion, without any fourme or maner of lawfull judgement, that he ſeperated him ſelfe from her and forſoke her. And what raſhnes or rather foly may it be comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, to reply or wryte againſt ſo manyfeſt a troth with conjectures? as to ſay, it is not likely that K. <hi>Henry</hi> wold ever have conſented that his Siſter ſhould mary one which had an other Wyfe lyvinge. Since that ther is yet ſo meny lyvely Wittneſſes, the which of certeyn knowledge can be Teſtes,<note place="margin">The ſaide <hi>Charles</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chid with the Frenche Queene <hi>1515.</hi> She di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anno. 1532.</hi> La. <hi>Mortimer</hi> died <hi>An. 1533.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> and the Lady <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> wer Man and Wyfe, and have ſeene and did know the Lady <hi>Mortimer</hi> longe after the mariage, yea, and peradventure after the death of the ſaid French Q. And touchinge the K. although it is to be thought, that yf he had known that the Duke had had an other Wyfe lyving, that he wold not have conſentyd that his Siſter ſhold have maryed him: It might be notwithſtanding full well, and it is poſſible that yet he had one, and that the Kinge mought not know thereof. For as Princes have ben the greater or the mightier, ſo much the leſſe, comonly, have they ben wontyd to underſtand of the doinges in ſuch maters of pryvate Perſons. But in this caſe ther be as perfecte Clerkes, and of as goode underſtandinge as any were, at th' adviſe of theſe Bookes abrode, that ar of opinion cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the French Q. and the Duke wer matchid before the Kinge was prevy thereof: and ſome Pardon or Pardons obteyned for the ſame, upon ſmall ſearch, may happen to be founde that may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifye as much; and of neceſſity, we can no otherwyſe thinke, but that it was ſo: Synce that as much as is ſayd of the Lady <hi>Mortimer,</hi> may be affirmyd by the ſayd Witneſſes as a thinge moſt certeyne and notorious. The which beinge true, then is it certeyn that the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſaid French Q. cold not be his lawfull Wyfe. And that the ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suff.</hi> could not lyve with her but in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.

                  <p>To theſe greate Reaſons, and their Authority, it is eaſy ynnough to anſwer.

But they were Princes, the Woman the Kinge's Syſter, and the Man a Duke, and in greate favour with the Prince, in ſuch ſorte, that the greate and the iminent danger and perill that did depend therof, was, and is the aparaunt and manifeſt cauſe why no Man did or durſt begin with theim, or attempt eny ſuch matter, and ſpecially in a thinge that touchid any whitte the diſpleaſure or diſhonour of the Kinge himſelfe: And therfore that long contynuance in Matrimony, after that ſort, without controverſy, is not to be countyd for quiet and peaceable, but rather injurious and violent. <note n="(d)" place="margin">Arg. l. in. fi.

But thoſe Noble Men, as jelous of the Honour, Fame, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of their Countrey, did thinke that <hi>it importyd a great deal more to maynteyne and aſſure the Dignitie of the whole Realme, refuſinge a Perſon of doubtfull Birth, then to have reſpecte unto the particuler Intereſt of that Child.</hi> And thus tendrid theſe ſo much this Honour, that they could not, nor wold not tary the tyme to entreate of the Succeſſion, when it ſhuld happe, but wold, by and by, put the mater out of doubt. And you, when it is ſo needfull, and the tyme doth ſo require it, to knowe one certeynly for your Prynce and juſt Governour heerafter; Will you make no compt herof? They, I ſay, for theſe reſpectes, did refuſe one, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to th' ordinary courſe of the Law, they moght eaſely have preſumed of to have ben legitimate: And will yow ſubmitte your ſelfes to a perſon, that, accordinge to the ordinary and Canon Rule and Order of the Lawe, is ſo manifeſtly knowen, taken and ſhewyd, diſcendid playnely as illegitimate? Oh take heede, for yf ever this happe in your Heddes, what other thinge will it turne or growe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but vnto an open and univerſall declaration unto all the World, that yow, betweene Honour and Diſhonour, Right or Wronge, cauſes of Proſperyte or Ruyne, do make no difference at all: Which opinion once conceyvid of yow, boaſt, bragge, or compare after, the Nobilitie or Excellency of your Countrey, or the Stouteneſſe of your Selfes, with other Nations, ye may well ynuough; but whoe wyll not rather mocke or ſcorne at your madneſſe or folly, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue yow as of eny Reaſon or Judgment?</p>
                  <p>And this that is ſayd (as is before touchid) hath auctoryte, and is, both accordinge to Divine, Canon, and Civill Lawe, and beſydes, accordinge to the Lawe of Nature and Reaſon. But though we ſhuld admitte, that by the Canon Lawe theiſe deſcendentes of the French Q. were to be tolleratyd or allowid as legitimate, yet doth it not follow, for all that, that in this Realme they ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or accompted for ligitimate or inheritable: Bicauſe that for eny to be borne legitimate, heritable or Baſtard Heere, is judged, not accordinge to the Canon Law, but accordinge to the Lawe of the Realme. And this doth appeere manifeſtly, by the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> Cap. 9. Where the Biſhops inſtanced the Lordes, that they wold conſent that all ſuch as wer borne before Matrimony, ſhuld be legitimate according to the Canon Lawe, as well as they that wer borne within Matrimony. Which could not be obteyned; but determination made, that they ſhuld ſtande unto the Lawes of the Realme, and not unto the Canons: And that one borne of a ſecond Wyfe (the firſt ſtill lyvinge, by occaſion of ignorance, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wyfe may pretend, that the Husband had no other Wyfe alyve) ſhuld be taken or compted for ligitimate or inheritable, is not aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by our Lawe. But playnly the contrary, as may appear by <hi>Bracton, Glandvill, Britton, Parkins,</hi> and the whole courſe of the Lawe. Wherfore to alledge that it is not lawfull to compt ſuch for Baſtardes after their death, though during their Lyfe they wer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or compted for no other, then as legitimate, is a poore healpe, a ſlender proof, and to this purpoſe makith nothinge at all; for <hi>Litle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Cap. of Diſcentes doth declare, that this continuance to purge

the Baſtardy, is not to be alleadgid in every ſorte of Baſtardie, but in that onely that is born of the Woman that the Father doth after mary, with other Circumſtances, as may appeer, farre from this Mater. But to object that heerin might further have fortunyd, though peradventure there hapt never eny ſuch mater, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge may be thought of now, or ells remembrid heerafter, that in this caſe to the uttermoſt that might have chaunſed, may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be fully ſayd unto, and anſweryd; Let us admitte, for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinge of the Baſtardy of theſe Iſſues, that the Pope's Bulle mought have been obteynid, (which though both agaynſt eny godly and lawful Matrimony, and agaynſt the Law of the Lande, perhappes, mought eaſely have been compaſſed) yet notwithſtandinge ſhuld the ſame have made as little to the purpoſe, as th' other proper Reaſons before alledgid: For ſuch a Bulle (though it had ben of valour in <hi>England,</hi> as it is neither now, nor yet ever was when the Pope was heere in greatiſt Authoryte) ſhuld either haue pronounced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſame Children to haue ben legitimately borne; or ells of Baſtardes, it ſhuld have made theim legitimate.</p>
                  <p>In as moche as it ſhuld have declarid theim to haue ben legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately borne, it had ben needefull that it ſhuld haue ben with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncinge the Matrimony with the ſaid Queene and Duke legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, notwithſtandinge the other Wyfe had ben alyue; and that could not have ben grauntyd, (the caſe being as it was) but vpon ſome falſe or fayned ſurmiſe. And therfore, accordinge to their owne Lawes or Canons, it ſhuld haue ben of no force or valour. But let it haue ben accordinge to what Canon they had lyſted; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of this Realme of <hi>England</hi> ſhuld never haue ben bounden by any ſuch Bulle, and ſpecially when the mater vpon eny Poynt of Illegitimacion is to be callid in queſtion, by reaſon of eny Iſſue joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon Baſtardie, after the death of the Parties, which ar to be impeached as Baſtardes, by reaſon of eny ſecond, or other Mariage, during the Lyfe of the firſt Wyfe, the ſame being never upon eny Sute at the Common Lawe brought in Queſtion,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bracton,</hi> F. <hi>216.</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a ſpecial return at that time required. Of which more in the ſecond Part.</note> whileſt the Parties in whome Baſtardie is not allegid, lyvid. The greateſt doubt that in ſuch caſe mought haue hapt, is, that if the mater had ben callid in queſtion at the Common Law, duringe the Pope's Juriſdiction in the Lyues of eny of the Children of the ſaid Duke and the Frenche Queene (which be now all deceaſſed) and an Iſſue had ben joined vpon general Baſtardy, or vpon ſome other generall Iſſue of Divorce, the ſame ſhuld then haue ben tried by the Certificate of the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therby, perhaps, by ſomme ſuch ſleightful Certificate, the vnlawfull Doings of the Pope (if eny ſuch had ben in his tyme) might ſo haue ben allowed covertly. But allowing it were triable at this day by the Ordinary, the Pope's Diſpenſation carryeth not in our Law the Juriſdiction of the Ordinary; nor is not ſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyvid, but it muſt recyve a Tryal directly by th' Ordinary, whoſe Certificate muſt proceede accordinge to ſuch mater as may informe a Truthe, or ells it muſt receyve the Tryall by a Jury of twelve Men, according to the common uſage of Tryalles. And whoe can thinke, if the cauſe of eny ſuch ſeparation, ſtirred upon no juſt Motion, but onely of corrupte or fleſhly diſpoſition, ſhuld come now in queſtion; that either eny Ordinary, or ells eny Jury, in ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44505:104"/>
playne and open Baſtardy, wold either ſo farre forgeete or hazard theimſelfes, or elles exceede the Bondes of their Dutyes to God, their Countrey, or all honeſt Reputation to the World, to certify ſuch Iſſues to be ligitimate; wherby no Controverſy ſhuld be decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but rather dangerouſly encreaſed, and the whole Government of ſuch a Noble Realme therby brought unto a double Baſtardy as the caſe now ſtandith: For touchinge th' Iſſues betweene the Duke and the French Queene, yf queſtion be askyd whether they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? anſwer is made, They are not, becauſe the Duke was firſt lawfully marryed to the Lady <hi>Mortymer,</hi> and contynued with her aboue ſeven Yeres; and that he was maryed after to the French Queene, duringe the ſayd Lady <hi>Mortymer</hi>'s Lyfe, whoe overlyved the byrth of all the French Queenes Children: Which anſwer, by our Law, cleerly diſtroyeth the ſeconde Mariage, and makith it voyde, and ſo all the Iſſues cleerly Baſtardes. And this is th' abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Judgementof our Lawe, ſo as now th' Iſſues of the French Queene cannot eny way help theimſelfes, but they muſt firſt deſtroy the firſt maryage, which our Lawe will never diſallowe untill it be firſt diſanulled. And therfore yf the Duke of <hi>Suff.</hi> had had eny Iſſue by the L. <hi>Mortimer,</hi> thoſe Iſſues ſhuld haue ben allowed his Heyres, by our Lawe, notwithſtandinge the Mariage after with the French Queene. And therfore for that the French Queenes Iſſues reſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabled in poynt of Common Lawe, they muſt make theimſelfes able, by ſome ſuch proofe as may ſatisfye the ſame Lawe, before they can be receyvid. And yf they ſeeke their relief by eny diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> (as is ſayd) it ſervith not, although ther wer a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce to be proovyd by eny ſuch Inſtrument. And it is moſt true, that they ar able to proove no lawfull Devorce within the Realme, though by ſearch it hath not onely ben perceyvid, but is evidently to be provyd howe meny corrupte and ſubtile attemptes by ſundry meanes hath ben taken in hande to cowntenance thoſe matches with the French Queene and other, as by a ſuppoſition of a Sute ſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one <hi>Anne Browne</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> wherof ſhuld aryſe the diſpleaſure betweene the Lady <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> her Husband, ſeven Yeres and more after their Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: During which time the ſaid <hi>A. B.</hi> God wotte, never tooke it ſo earneſtly as ſhe once complaynid to the Lawe, or ever thought of the Mater, nor as it ſeemith wold ever haue done, yf in this tyme the ſayd <hi>Charles</hi> had not conſumyd the ſayd Lady <hi>Mortimers</hi> Welth and Lyvelyhoode, and found her Yeres not anſwerable to his Yeouth and wanton Diſpoſition; for ſatisfyenge wherof, this Acquayntance, that Bely riſinge, and theſe Practiſes after hapt with the ſame <hi>Anne.</hi> Wherof riſeth now theſe feeble-groundid Hiſtories, this Speche, and theſe Devices, that ſhe forſooth ſhuld be precontracted to him before, and had a Childe; which Childe, eight Yeres after, is knowen well inoghe, was but two or three Yeres olde at the moſte. A ſtrange caſe; and yet ſhe had it at ſeventeen, or ninteen, and was but twenty at the tyme of this ſuppoſed Divorce, when the ſayd <hi>Charles</hi> and ſhe came togither. Well, I ſay no more, for the Caſe is skant worth the ſpeakinge of; but yf this Mater wer to be ſhewid, ye ſhuld ſee ſuch a patron of a Divorce, as they that fayneſt wold have it, wold ſooneſt be aſhamyd to countenance their Title
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44505:104"/>
upon the ſame; and yet theſe Paſſages thus hapt in theſe Dayes, and in that Lyfe, from better to worſe, advoutry upon advoutry, and ſuch other ſtuff.</p>
                  <p>But how vayne is it to wryte, or to occupy yow with theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, as with what mought haue ben, what is ſuppoſed to haue bene, or ſuch other vayne and frivolous practiſes or ſhifts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as heerafter may be, when it behoovith ſo much preſently to conſyder what in this caſe properly may and ought to be? And therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is one of the moſt aſſuryd wayes to underſtand what the Lawe willeth, or is in eny queſtion to admitte, that the Mater were at preſent to be decided by dewe courſe of Lawe, with all the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies that on bothe partes may be uſed for their moſt avayle and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſo to bringe the ſame in Forme of Lawe to ſuch a poynt, as judgement may be therof gyven rightly. Take heerin for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample, that <hi>I. S.</hi> made a Gifte of Lande to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Suff.</hi> and the Frenche Queene, after their Mariage, and the Heires of their Bodyes; and now the ſame <hi>I.S.</hi> bringith his Action of Forme-downe in reverter for the ſame Lande, agaynſt the Lady <hi>K.</hi> and her Siſter, and the reſydue of that Lyne; and ſuppoſeth that the Land ought to him to revert, for lacke of Iſſue lawfully begotten betweene the Duke and the French Queene: and they come and pleade, by way of Barr, the Mariage betweene the French Queene and the Duke, and convey the Pedegree lineally. Wherunto <hi>I. S.</hi> replieth, and ſhewith a former Maryage with the Lady <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and averrith her Lyfe after their Birth. And the Lady <hi>K.</hi> and the reſt, cannot by Lawe maynteyne their Barr, and deſtroy his Title, unleſſe they pleade a lawfull Divorce; and yf they pleade eny ſuch, yet the ſame ſhall not be under the Pope's Bulle, but by the Certificate of th' Ordinary, and for that th' Ordinary hath no Recorde, or other lawfull Proofe, wherupon he can lay eny Foundation to certify any lawful Divorce, therfore the Certificate cannot be avaylable. And ſo to conclude, ther is no doubt in the troth of the caſe, and by lyke reaſon no doubt in Lawe (if you will allowe the Proceedinges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to troth) but that the Baſtardie remaynith, and is not able to be purged.</p>
                  <p>And yf the Bulle ſhuld have ben to make the Children of the ſayd Queene and Duke of Baſtardes legitimat, beſydes the Reaſons before alledgid, which ar as effectuall in this purpoſe as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet it is moſt true, that ſuch legitimation had ben of no more force or Vertue heere in this Realme of <hi>Englande,</hi> then they be of in thoſe Contreyes that ar at the Pope's Obedience. And who ſoever is legitimated ther of the Pope, is not to be underſtandid for all that, to be legitimate to inherite, but in the Lands that do belonge vnto the Churche. <note n="(i)" place="margin">Imo, in ca. per venerabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem qui filii ſint legi.</note>. And beſydes, who ſoever, is legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and abled generally to eny Dignitie, is not in that neither to be underſtandid legitimatid vnto a Royall Dignitie. <note n="(k)" place="margin">Barthol. &amp; Bal. in l. eam quam. <hi>C.</hi> de fide. con.</note> And the Reaſon is, that whoſoever is borne Baſtard, though he be after made legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, is ever reputyd, notwithſtandinge, as infamous. <note n="(l)" place="margin">Bal. in lege generaliter §. cum autem. <hi>C.</hi> de inſt. &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti. ſub condi. factis. &amp; Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. in 3. ff. de il. &amp; poſt.</note>. And theſe Reaſons may ſerve alſo to the Allegations before ſayd, of the innocency of the Queene, and the contynuance of the Matrimony without controverſy: for they do declare playnly, that although the Lawes, where they entreate of eny other Enheritance, ſhuld make
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44505:105"/>
as legitimate the Children ſo borne (the which indeede they no ways can do, as we have partly proovyd) notwithſtanding that the ſame Laws could never be alledgid in caſe of Succeſſion to eny great Dignite, and chiefly vnto a <hi>Royal Dignitie, in the which the whole ſtate of the Common Wealth hath intereſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And beſydes, touching the dooble Baſtardy before remembryd, though we ſhuld admitte that of the legitimacion of the Lady <hi>K.</hi> there wer no doubt or queſtion, yet ſuch hath ben her Life, and Behavour, and ſo much hath ſhe ſtayned her ſelf and iſſue; as ſhe is to be thought unworthy of the Crown: for ſhe was maryed (as ye know) to the Lord <hi>Herberd:</hi> The Mariage was perfected by all neceſſary Circumſtances, ther was conſent of the Parties, conſent of the Parentes, open ſolemnizinge, contynuance after, till lawfull Years of conſent, and in the mean time carnall Copulation, all which, ſave the laſt, are commonly knowne by dyuers that ſawe theim, and the laſt, which to all other might be moſt doubtfull, is known by the confeſſion of them both, and ſo made the more lykely to be true, bicauſe ſhe her ſelf (though in ſuch thinges that Sexe be moſt covert and ſhamefaſt) hath yet earneſtly acknowledgid the ſame: after which Conſummacion every Man knowith that albeit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony had been before for lacke of Years not vaylable, that yet thereby it commith and is made perfect, and of full force and valor. In ſorte that the Divorce and Sentence that was ſo dryven, procured and practiſed by the means of the Erle of <hi>Penbroke</hi> in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> Reign (for reſpects then well ynough knowne) agyinſt both the Parties Wills as moſt manifeſtly appeeryd, not onely by their greate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willigneſſe unto it then, but alſo by their affectionate and willinge manner of lyving, continent meny Years after, continuing in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Love teſtified by ſondrey means, meny Tokens, Meſſingers, and other ſignes of the ſame, cannot be of eny force to breake the ſayd Matrimony, <hi>niſi de facto.</hi>

But this done the L. <hi>Herbert</hi> ſeeinge himſelf thus deceyvid by his Wyfe, did (as he might lawfully) joyne himſelfe in Marying with an other Woman, and that Lyfe and Uſage betweene the Lady <hi>K.</hi> and the Erle beinge confirmid by dooble Iſſue, as it was utterly unlawfull before God, ſo was it founde unlawfull before ſuch Biſhoppes, and other Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, as had the heeringe of the ſame, and their Iſſue baſtardid; wherupon doth fall out, as ye ſee, greate wickednes and laſhnes of Life in the Mother, and baſtardy in the Children.

Wherfore, to retourne to the Mater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in hand, and to conclude therof. Since eny Spotte, or ſuſpicion of eny, is ſufficient barre from th' Inheritance of a Crowne, much more cauſe is this playne and open Baſtardy; for <hi>we ar all bounde in reaſon to haue alwayes more regard to the State and Dignitie of the whole Weale Publique, then of the pryvate Preferment or Commodyte of eny particuler Perſon.</hi> And ſo doth it appeere, that by no way, neither by the Divine Lawe, nor by the Common Lawe of this Realme, nor yet by the Canon or Civill, that the Children deſcendid of the ſayd Queene and Duke, can be capable of the Crowne by their Birth.</p>
                  <p>But touchinge the other Parte, they alledge in favour of the Lady <hi>Katheryne,</hi> Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his Will, by which they ſay ſhe is lefte as Heire.

And the words of the ſame Statute, though they be generall, they may not, for all that, be ſo largely taken or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandid, as they may be ſtretched vnto: For who will ſay, that by thoſe wordes, <hi>there is Power or Facultie gyven to appoynt or gyve the Crowne to eny Perſon, that accordinge to the Lawe and Dignitie of this Realme, is not meete or capable of the ſame?</hi> As vnto a <hi>Turke,</hi>

                  <p>But though he had Power or Authority to diſpoſe of the Crowne, to the Heires of the Lady <hi>Francys,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Eleanor,</hi> it is trewe yet notwithſtandinge he could not do that, but with the Condition and Forme, that by Power of the Parliament was gyven him, that is, either by his Letters Patentes, vnder the Greate Seale of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or ells by his laſt Will, ſigned with his moſt Gratious Hande.</p>
                  <p>By Letters Patentes without doubt he hath not done it, and ſo of the Will is the Controverſy. But beinge able to make a ſufficient and perfect Will, to all other intentes and purpoſes, either in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge to his Hand, or ells in not puttinge to his Hand; yet yf the Kinge have made his Will, without puttinge unto his Hand (as ther be Wittneſſes ſufficient, and ſome of thoſe that ſubſcribed the ſame Teſtament, in that behalf can ſo truely and plainly teſtify, that he hath, as there is no ſuch Cauſe left therfore either of ſuch doubt, or elles of ſuch conferringe, or comparinge the Prothocall with the Signe or Stampe, as thoſe that haue ſette foorthe theſe Books wold ſeeme to make; then it is playne and manifeſt that he hath not done it to this purpoſe, accordinge to the forme and maner preſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the Statute. And every Acte or Deede that is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Forme preſcribed by Lawe, is inſufficient, <note n="(r)" place="margin">L. 1. in pr. ff. de ſtipula. l. traditionibus.

And ſo, accordinge to the Civill Lawe, in that Teſtament that they call a Solempne Teſtament, in the which there is required meny Circumſtances; yf eny of thoſe do lacke, the Teſtament, or Will, is of no force or valour. <note n="(t)" place="margin">Juſtin. de teſta. &amp; lege jube. C. ibidem.</note> Beſydes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the ſame Lawe, all Statutes, or Agreements made, that takith away, or correctith eny thinge of or from the Courſe or Body of the Lawe, is reputed and taken as odious, and ought to be taken ſtrictly, even accordinge to the Letter as the worde ſtandith. And this Statute wherof we now ſpeake, is ſuch a One: For wher the Succeſſion of the Crowne ſhuld have gone whither the Common Lawe had apoynted or directid it, as vnto the next by the Statute of 35 of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; K. <hi>Henry</hi> had Auctority to leve it to whome he lyſted. And therfore this Statute is to be interpretid ſtrictly and preciſely as the worde gyveth: That is, that Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> onely by his Letters Patentes, vnder the Great Seale of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or elles by his laſt Wyll, ſigned with his moſt gratious Hand, might name whome he would to the Succeſſion of the Crowne, and not otherwyſe. And lykewiſe by the Common Lawe of this Realme, the Statute is moſt plainly a direct abridgement of the ſame, by reaſon it takith from the Common Lawe, the naturall limitation of th' Inheritance of the Crowne, and appointith it owte of the Rule of the Lawe, to the Order and Limitation of Kinge <hi>Henry</hi>; beinge in this reſpect authorized but as a private Perſon. And it is in ſome degree a Penal Lawe, for it takith the Title of a Kingedome from thoſe that by the Common Lawe have a Right, and makith, in poynt of execution, a Subject of a Prince, and contrarywyſe a Prince of a Subject; which is not onely penall, as hauinge reſpect to the loſſe of their Title to the Crowne, yf it ſhuld ſo happe, as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidd; but alſo it is ſo penall, that if ſuch ill Chaunce ſhuld unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately befall, it makith Traytors of thoſe that will clayme their Inheritance, although their intent were but to try their Titles. And it is a Learninge by the Common Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> that longe hath ben ſo receyvid, that in every ſuch caſe as eny of theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, no Expoſition is to be allowed; but the Lawe willith us to cleve to the Letter, without eny further wreſtinge therof, then the Letter naturally and ſtrictly will reache unto. So that if it be not a ſtricte obſervation of the Letter, according to his natural entent, in any of theſe caſes the Common Lawe allowith it not. And the rather the Lawe is preciſe herin, for that it is a newe Statute, which ſeldome ar taken by equite in eny point, becauſe they ar all pennyd at large. As for Example; I will remember one or twoe, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44505:107"/>
may ſuffice to ſuch as be Learnyd, to ſearch for other of lyke effect, wherof ther ar not a few. In <hi>Anno</hi> 1. of Kinge <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> ther was a Statute made, That if eny were condemnid for the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of Horſes and Mares, they ſhould loſe their Clergy; and becauſe the words Horſes and Mares were the plurall nombre; it was taken not to extende to one Horſe, or to one Mare. And ſo for that cauſe a new Statute was made, <hi>Anno</hi> 2. of the ſame K. that made lyke Lawe for ſtealinge one Horſe, or one Mare. And the chief cauſe of this was, becauſe it is a Penall Statute, in takinge from a Man that, wherby his Lyfe might be ſavid. In K. <hi>Richard</hi> the 3<hi>ds</hi> Tyme, there was a Statute made to Auctorize <hi>Ceſt a que uſe</hi> to enter vpon his Feoffees, and make Feoffementes. And it was in queſtion, in <hi>Anno</hi> 9. of <hi>H.</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> yf he made a Letter of Atturney, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were good by the Statute, and lefte therfore a doubtfull queſtion, by reaſon the Statute gyveth auctoryte onely, which muſt in all poyntes be obſerved. And ther is a greate deale more coulour to make that Feoffement goode, being by Letter of Atturney, then to make this Will to this purpoſe goode, not ſigned with the Kinges owne Hande: For if eny other put his Hande therunto, and not the Kinge himſelf, then it is ſigned with an other Hande, and not the Kinges Hande. And yf I gyve Auctorytie to my Executors to ſell my Landes, and ſay no further; then, yf they ſell the ſame by Wrytinge, or without Wrytinge, it is ſufficient; but if I adde theſe wordes, That they ſhall ſell my Landes, ſo that they do it by Wrytinge, ſigned with their proper Handes; yf now they ſell the ſame, and th' one cauſe the Reſidue, in all their preſence, to wryte all their Names, as thoughe every one had ſeverally ſubſcrybed; I hold it no queſtion, but this Sale is not good; for they muſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their Auctorytie ſtrictlye, and otherwyſe it is of no effect: And conſyderinge, as is partly before remembryd, how greate a mater it was to committe ſuch a Truſt, it were a greate lacke and ſlander to the whole Parliament, to thinke that they wold condiſcend to the committinge of ſo high and weightie a Confidence, as wherof the whole Eſtate and Weale of the Realme ſhuld depend, but that they did forſee that their doinges therein ſhuld not be blynded by a Wrytinge ſigned with a Stampe,<note place="margin">The ſame thing was urg'd by <hi>Lethington</hi> the Secretary of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Letter to Sir <hi>Will. Cecil.</hi> Appendix to the <hi>2</hi>d Vol. of the Hiſt. of the Ref. <hi>F. 269.</hi>
                     </note> which might be put vnto, either when the Kinge was voyde of Memory, or els when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſid; as indeed it after happenyd, as moſt manifeſtly appeeryd by open declaration made in Parliament by the late L. <hi>Paget,</hi> and others, that King <hi>Henry</hi> did not ſigne it with his owne Hande, as it is playne and probable inough by the Pardon obteynid for one <hi>William Clerke,</hi> for puttinge the Stampe vnto the ſayde Will after the Kinge was departid: and who doubtith but yf his meaninge had ben ſuch, ſo to haue diſpoſed of the Crowne, but that he wold have put this mater out of doubte, by ſignifyenge the ſame with his owne proper Hande.</p>
                  <p>And touchinge the two chief Examples that ar brought foorth, the one of the 21 and 33 of K. <hi>H.</hi> th' Eight, wherby K. <hi>H.</hi> was aucthorized to gyve his Royall Aſſent to Actes of Parliament, by his Letters Patentes, and ſo foorth: and th' other, for that Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> omittyd the ſtyle that was apoyntid by Parliament, in 35
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44505:107"/>
of <hi>H.</hi> th' Eight, in her Parliament Writts, howe little they make to the matter every Man may judge: For the Statutes of 21, and 33 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. were only made in affirmance of the Common Lawe, and ſuch a Royal Aſſent wold ſuffice, by Letters Patents without eny aſſurance thereof by the Signe. And this Statute was but to put ſuch matter out of queſtion; for if the Common Law had ben ſuch before, there is no doubt but that he muſt haue ſigned every Patent with his proper Hande; and ſo theſe Caſes are no way lyke. And touchinge the ſeconde, yf the Statute that conteynith the King's Style be well conſyderid, there wold be made thereof no ſuch Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. For the ſame apoyntith a puniſhment to ſuch Subjects as of purpoſe depryve the K. of the Realm, of that Stile. But there is no doubt, but the Writts that wantyd the Stile, were in Lawe ſufficy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the Parties that made the ſame, puniſhable. So that theſe Examples cannot be wreſtid to ſerve eny whit for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And where ther is made a great mater by reaſon the Will was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollid in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and <hi>Conſtats</hi> thereof made under the Broade Seale, and the Legacyes thereof in all poyntes performyd. To that may be anſwerd; That all that is therein affirmed may eaſily be confeſſed, and yet it proovith nothinge to th'intent applied; for it was his Will is ever he condeſcendid thervnto, though he did never ſigne it with his Stampe, nor with his Hande, and a goode and a perfect Will to all Entents and Purpoſes, whereof he had by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawe Authoritye to make his Will of.</p>
                  <p>But it is not, or cannot be the more a perfect Will to this reſpect or purpoſe, vnleſſe he did execute the auctoritie apoyntid by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of, 35 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. as is before remembryd. Since then the Duke had a Wyfe lyvinge, when he maryd the Frenche Queene, and by the Statute ther is nothinge to be Claymid, onles K. <hi>Henry</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eny things either by his Letters Patentes under the Broade Seal of <hi>Englande,</hi> or ells by his laſt Will ſigned with his moſt gracious Hande: And that it is trewe, that he had a Wyfe lyvinge when he maryd the Frenche Queene; that ſo if it were requiſite, or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be, there mought be avouchid more then one, with much other matter touchinge that poynt of Illegitimacion and Inhabilitie, as well in thinges paſte, as alſo in thinges preſent: And that moſt certeynly there was never either eny ſuch Letters Patentes paſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greate Seale of <hi>England,</hi> nor yet eny ſuch Will ſigned with his moſt gratious Hande, as ſufficient Witneſſes yet lyvinge can well teſtify. Theiſe two maters touchinge the legitimation and validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Will in that behaulf, of eny indifferent Perſon, I truſt, may be acceptid as fully and truly anſweryd.</p>
                  <p>And thus (lovinge Reader) have I vtteryd and layd before the theiſe caſes as they ar. And whome wold it not moove to commpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to behould the ſtate of theſe thinges? or whoſe Engliſh Harte wold it not grieve, even to every parte of it, to fynde any ſuch Bookes countenanced, or accompt made of ſuch Baſtardie ſlippes (as appeerith by thoſe Opinions and Bookes, ſpredde) to enherite ſo noble a Realme, our moſt deere and natural Countrey? as though it wer either ſo infortunate, ſo curs'd of God, or elſe ſo farre from

Mercy, that ſuch ſhuld be fitter for the ſame, without eny colour of eny juſt Title, to plague it with moſt infamous Diſſention, Warre, and all other Confuſion, and ſo to bring it to vtter ruyne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; then thoſe to whome of right it ought, both by the Lawe of God and Man moſt iuſtly to belonge vnto. What is he that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemith or tendrith the proſperyte of the Countrie in the favour of God, or the good fame or fortune of the Worlde, that wold ſeeke to exalt vnto the Government therof ſuch <hi>infamous and ſpottyd titles,</hi> with which is lynked alwayes ſuch wrathe of God, and th'Effectes thereof, with ſuch continuall ſtryfe and contention; before the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaynid true and perfect Inheritors apoynted by him, and by his Lawes, to ſette forth his Glory: and by whoſe Juſtice ſuch ar al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes proſperyd and defendid: to their own honour, and the great weale and ſafety of their Subjects, as longe as they remayne in his feare, and obedyent vnto his Lawes and Ordinances. <hi>But what might be ſayd further: Yf thoſe in greate face and ſhew of great zeale and iuſtice, and in greate authoritie, hath ſo much neglected their Duties, and ſo much preferryd theire owne Ambitions and corrupte De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyres, before the Honour and Service of the Realme, as ſuch have not ſticked to further theſe ſpottyd and coulerid Titles, and alſo to encourage other to fall vnto the ſame. What a caſe is this, that ſuch ſo placyd, ſhuld go aboute to extol ſuch motions of Diſhonour and ruyne of their naturall Countrey, and yet remayne with their Callinge in ſo greate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of honour for their Good and faithful Service. O</hi> England, <hi>blame thow not the inferior ſorte ſo much, that doth but receyve theſe thinges as it is miniſtryd unto them, by whoſe credyte and perſuaſion they may be eaſily abuſd. But ſeeke thou to decifer and diſcover ſuch Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, as have more regard to mainteyne theimſelfes, by whoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, or what wronge ſo ever it be, then to proceede dirertly to thy Service, either to the Honour of God, Author and Favorer of all Truth, or els to thy Weale, Proſperytie, and quietnes. And I exhorte the, and exhorte the agayne, not to ſuffer thy ſelf to be ledde and caryd away with eny ſuch foule iniurious Perſwaſion, either of ambitious Abuſer, or ſuch other corrupt or vnadviſed Perſon.</hi> For ſuch foule iniurious and falſe perſuaſions ar apt to no other ende, but to ſerve Sedition, Diſcord, and Diſſention in the, and overthrow alſo all thoſe that dealith with theim. And how hard and perilous it is to obteyne a Crowne by eny injuſt or ſiniſter Title, and how much harder the things got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it hath ben to contynew and keepe the ſame, we may daily ſee and learne in dyvers Hiſtoryes of ſondry places by ſuch lyke For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and of the in that of K. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> the 5. and <hi>H.</hi> the 6. who after they had <hi>withholden the Crowne by</hi> wronge, with the loſſe of meny a Manne's Lyfe, two diſcentes, wherin paſſed forty Yeres and more; at laſt were overthrowne and quite confoundid, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoryd to Kinge <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, that rightly requyrd and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obteynid the ſame. Compare theſe togither, and conſider what multitude of Friends ſuch continuance in poſſeſſion was lyke to make, and of what fame and worthyneſſe the Princes were, and yet that the 3<hi>d.</hi> and laſt could not enioy the ſame, all that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge. And it may be ſuppoſd; that there is fewe ſo ſimple, ſo farre from reaſon, or ſo affectionate, but may thinke that K. <hi>H.</hi> the 6
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44505:108"/>
was much more abler to defend ſo longe a contynued Poſſeſſion, then the Lady <hi>K.</hi> or eny comminge of the French Queene is able both to gayne the lyke, and afterwards to keep it. By which, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examples, we may call to mynde, that God doth not favour thoſe that doth vſurpe with eny injuſt or indirect Title agaynſt his Will and Ordinance. And what greater miſhappe, diſcomfort, or Miſery can happ to eny, then after the liftinge up to ſuch a degree, or th' attaininge of eny ſuch deſire, in a moment to loſe all, and to be caſt downe to vtter confuſion, both they and all their Freendes for ever. Conſider, for the love of God, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your Countrey, the Suretie and Quietnes of your Freendes and Neighbours, Kynſemen and deere Country-folkes! remember the Threttes pronouncyd of God againſt all Injuſtice, and call to remembrance where aboute yow goe, ye that ſtudy and endeavour your ſelfes to ſette forth theſe falſe and deceyvable Titles in the parte or favour of eny; and beholde, that inſteade of the ſhadow of your vndewe Deſire, to the greate hazard and perill of the tranquill and peaceable ſtate of your moſt deere Friendes, and natural Contrey, that yow do but procure bothe to ſuch as how wold ſeeme to favour, and alſo vnto your ſelfes, ſuch danger, grief and ſorowe, with ſuch yll and adverſe Fortune, as your moſt bitter and dedly Enemyes could no way wyſh yow greater.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, thus much is due to th'Anſwer of the Bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, with th'advancement of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the French Queen's Iſſue, and ſettinge foorth of theſe Caſes of Baſtady, before yow: that after theſe maters thus manifeſtyd, there ſhuld inſewe of ſuch Errors the leſſe inconvenience, and that ye might thereby hereafter the better judge what were in theſe caſes the fitteſt, both for the honour of God, and the Weale, proſperyte, and quyetnes of the whole Realme. But thow, O <hi>England,</hi> ar, by the Grace and greate Mercy of God, vnder the Gouernment of our moſt Gracious and Prudent Queene, who hath the ſame tender and lovinge care of the Weale-Publike, that the moſt carefull and lovinge Mothers have not greater for the Weale &amp; Saufety of theire moſt deere and beſt-belovyd Chyldren; of the which there may be daily ſeene moſt apparente and manifeſt Examples. Her maieſtie havinge governid thee, with the noble aſſiſtance of her Counſell, ſo meny Years, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Danger, and greate perill of Civill Warre, and moſt miſerable ſlaghter (as the caſe yet ſtandith) it is not to be thought, but that the Floude of Bloode (from which God defend thee) that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might be ſhedde, doth continually flowe before her Highnes pitifull and moſt mercifull Eyes. And that her Maieſtie taryeth but ſome goode tyde, moſt carefully to provyde for the ſame, as may be poſſible. Which it may pleaſe God to graunte vnto her Highnes, for th'Honer of Him, and the greate Benifyte of the whole Realme, with moſt convenyent ſpeede. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>IT having been my purpoſe to conſider all Objections of any weight in themſelves, or from the Authority of Perſons, which ſhould occur to me againſt the Right of Their <hi>Preſent Majeſties,</hi> and the Juſtice of their Undertaking our Deliverance; I ought not to paſs by Biſhop <hi>Overall</hi>'s Convocation-Book, compos'd in the time of <hi>James</hi> I. Licenſed by the late Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſince his diſowning this Government, and Printed, as it is to be preſumed, with a manifeſt Intention of undermining it; for every Man may diſcern, that the Scheme of Government there drawn for the whole World, is contrary to the Foundation of our Preſent Settlement: but tho the Hypotheſis is laid together with much Subtilty, nothing but Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility can give it Authority; and to me it ſeems a piece of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only ſhort of that of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. For having made a Collection from <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> Hiſtory, and the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Writings, (tho of the laſt they ſay,<note place="margin">P. 64.</note> they mean not <hi>to attribute any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Authority unto them, nor to eſtabliſh any Point of Doctrine</hi>) they Canonically condemn, of Errors, all that agree not to their Inferences and Concluſions, upon a ſtate of Fact which at leaſt may be falſe.</p>
                  <p>This ſingle Obſervation might make it needleſs to conſider more particularly what is there ſaid, eſpecially, when I add this further, That it would make Scripture Examples under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, to have the force of Precepts now: which if they have, then the Examples of <hi>Jehu</hi> in killing wicked King <hi>Joram,</hi> then his Subject; and of <hi>Othniel,</hi>

                  <p>The Foundation of all, is the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Power of <hi>Adam,</hi> which they ſuppoſe to have been abſolutely Monarchical all the World over; that <hi>Noah</hi> had the like <hi>Authority all his Life</hi>; but that he <hi>divided the whole World among his Three Sons</hi>; upon which they conclude,<note place="margin">P. 84.</note> That if <hi>any Man affirm,</hi>

                  <p>But admit their Notion of the Abſolute Power of the Father ſhould hold, while the World was but one Family, and the Father might be ſuppoſed to be the ſole Proprietor; I doubt they cannot advance one ſtep further, without meer Fictions of their own Imaginations, or as vain and uncertain Tradition.</p>
                  <p>If we attend to the ſacred Text, freed from their impoſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons are by God himſelf made joynt Proprietors with him.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.1, 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> For the Text ſays, <hi>God bleſſed</hi> Noah <hi>and his Sons, and ſaid unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the fear of you, and the dread of you, ſhall be upon every Beaſt of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fiſhes of the ſea, into your hand are they delivered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this Donation had no effect, as to the Sons in the life-time of the Father, neither according to the Patriarchal Scheme, could the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sons have any Benefit in the life-time of the Elder; wherefore either here was a joynt Propriety in all, and conſequently the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt proceed from an expreſs or tacit Conſent of the Proprietors; or elſe they muſt be beholden to <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition, for the eſtabliſhing their Chriſtian Canon, concerning Government.</p>
                  <p>For two things, I muſt confeſs, we are obliged to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For pathetically deſcribing the unhappineſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>how Religion went in thoſe days,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 72.</note> 
                     <hi>when the Prieſts had gotten the Reins into their own Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For obſerving, That the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the moſt proud and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sects,<note place="margin">P. 79.</note> were the only Men who refuſed to ſwear Allegiance to <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi>;<note place="margin">Can. 30.</note> yet they ſay, <hi>If any Man ſhall affirm,</hi> that <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſt, having ſworn Allegiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> might have lawfully born Arms againſt him, he doth greatly err.</p>
                  <p>This is in a Canon which they raiſe from the Fact in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of <hi>Jaddus</hi>'s refuſing to aſſiſt <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Wars, and becoming Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as he had been to the <hi>Perſians</hi>; and this after <hi>Alexander</hi> had overthrown <hi>Darius,</hi> who eſcaped by Flight. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High Prieſt ſeems to put words into the Mouth of our late Archbiſhop, returning for anſwer, <hi>That he might not yield there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, becauſe he had taken an Oath of Allegiance to</hi> Darius, <hi>which he might not lawfully violate whilſt</hi> Darius <hi>lived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Compare this with the next Canon, according to the Analogy of their Doctrine, and ſee how it provides for the Security of <hi>Princes,</hi> and Obedience to their Governments.</p>

                     <hi>If any Man therefore ſhall affirm either, That the</hi> Jews <hi>generally, both Prieſts and People, were not the Subjects of</hi> Alexander, <hi>after his Authority was ſetled amongſt them, as they had been before the Subjects of</hi> Babylon <hi>and</hi> Perſia; <hi>or that they were not all bound to pray for the long Life and Proſperity, both of</hi> Alexander, <hi>and his Empire, as they had been bound before to pray for the Life and Proſperity of the

other ſaid Kings and their Kingdoms, whilſt they liv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Subjection; or conſequently, that they might lawfully upon any occaſion whatſoever, have offered Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Deſtruction, either to their Perſons, or to their Kingdoms, for the long continuance and Proſperity whereof, they were bound to pray; or that, after the</hi> Jews <hi>were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their Servitude under the Kings of</hi> Syria, <hi>and the Government over them, was ſetled in</hi> Mattathias's <hi>Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was lawful for the People upon any occaſion to have Rebelled againſt them, or to have offered Violence to their Perſons,</hi> He doth greatly err.</p>
                  <p>The Juſtice or Injuſtice of the War on either ſide, between <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> are made no part of the queſtion; but here are two Princes, both ſuppos'd <hi>Abſolute,</hi> with all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Power over their reſpective People, ſtaking their Kingdoms upon the chance of Battle; one of them is conquered and runs away; yet, according to our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts,</hi> the Conqueror is not entituled to the <hi>Fatherly</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Power over the other's People; but it is ſuſpended, at leaſt, during the Life of the King that was beaten, and the Authority not ſetled all that while: and if the Monarchy was Hereditary, it may be yet more difficult when to fix the Settlement. If it is admitted to be <hi>Setled</hi> in the life-time of the ejected and conquer'd Prince, and that it is a duty <hi>to pray for the Life and Proſperity of the</hi> Conqueror, <hi>and upon no occaſion to offer any Violence to his</hi> Perſon <hi>or</hi> Kingdom; yet, according to theſe <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> they were bound, at leaſt, during the Life of the Conquered Prince, to give no active Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the other, in Perſon, or Contribution. And thus it might be allowable to mock <hi>God Almighty,</hi> while they pray for that, to which they will not contribute the means in their Power; or elſe their Prayers were to have ſuch a mental Reſervation, as ſome have, who pray for King <hi>James,</hi> while they pray for [<hi>The King</hi>]. But if they were to pray for <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Proſperity without reſerve, one would think it was lawful, at leaſt, to Fight for him againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> notwithſtanding the Oath of Allegiance taken to <hi>Darius,</hi> by reaſon of the Authority which he had loſt.</p>
                  <p>If any one ſhall ſay, That this <hi>Convocation-Book</hi> was innocently publiſhed at this time, let him read the following <hi>Canon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any Man therefore ſhall affirm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>either that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when they ſhake off the Yoke of their Obedience to their Sovereigns, and ſet up a Form of Government among themſelves,</hi> after their own Humours, <hi>do not therein very wickedly, or that it is lawful for any</hi> Bordering Kings, <hi>through</hi> Ambition <hi>and</hi> Malice, <hi>to</hi> Invade <hi>their Neighbours: Or that the Providence and Goodneſs of God, in uſing of Rebellions and Oppreſſions to execute his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt any King or Country, doth mitigate, or qualify the Offences of any ſuch</hi> Rebels, <hi>or</hi> Oppreſſing Kings; <hi>or that when any ſuch new Forms of Government, begun by Rebellion, are after</hi> thoroughly Setled, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in them is not of God: <hi>or that any, who live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Territories of ſuch new Governments,</hi> are not bound to be Subject to God's Authority, <hi>which is there exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but may Rebel againſt the ſame: Or that the</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44505:112"/>
Jews, <hi>either in</hi> Egypt, <hi>or</hi> Babylon, <hi>might lawfully for any Cauſe, have taken Arms againſt any of thoſe Kings, or have offered any Violence to their Perſons,</hi> He doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Err.</p>
                  <p>If this be taken according to any rational, or ſo much as probable Account of Government in General, particularly applied to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution; I ſee no danger in admitting, that People ought not to throw off the Yoke of Obedience, and ſet up a Form of Government <hi>after their own Humours</hi>; and that it is not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in any <hi>Bordering King,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> through <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to Invade his Neighbours.</hi> And yet this would not in the leaſt condemn either the People of <hi>England,</hi> in ſhaking off a former illegal and arbitary Yoak, while yet they retain the ancient Form, and Fundamental Rights of the Government; or our <hi>Preſent Sovereign</hi> in his Heroical Undertaking our <hi>Deliverance.</hi> But if all Princes are as Abſolute as their Notion makes them, the Nation had no Ground of complaint, and His Preſent Majeſty's Expedition would fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Imputation of <hi>Ambitition,</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi>; 'tis certain, that no juſt cauſe could be aſſign'd for it upon their Principles; and yet theſe would as well condemn our <hi>Diſſenting Biſhops</hi> of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Late King,</hi> in not complying with the Commands of a Prince, whom this Book would make Abſolute.</p>
                  <p>And of this, the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> would have done well to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf, when he gave his Licenſe for the <hi>Church-Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> to put on this old ruſty Armor, which hung up without uſe for above eighty years,<note place="margin">Vid. Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, called <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to 1610.</note> had been full three, if not not ſix Years in hammering out, and was brought forth in this Critical Time, to do Wonders for their ſuppos'd King of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> of their making, at leaſt, if not of God's. Whileſt the Clergy in that, and following times, Wrote, and Preached for Preferments, and Condemn'd all Notions which lay in their way to it; it is to be feared, that they incurr'd the Curſe pronounced from more Divine Authority, againſt him that <hi>removes his Neighbours Land-mark.</hi> And he that would Model the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government by thoſe of the Eaſt of old, ſet up and maintain'd by Confuſion, would do well to tranſplant his Family into <hi>Turky,</hi> where he may find one of the trueſt Patterns of the fancied Patriarchal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>But if that, or the <hi>Anticyrae,</hi> to which an old <hi>Romam</hi> would have adviſed them, be too far for them to Travel in their Canonical Habit; they may take a ſtep into <hi>France,</hi> where its Monarch aſſumes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes a Power according to their Primitive Stamp.</p>
                  <p>Yet the latter part of the foregoing <hi>Canon</hi> tells you, That you are bound to be ſubject to <hi>God's Authority,</hi> even in thoſe <hi>new Governments,</hi> which are ſet up <hi>after the Humours</hi> of the People. So that fully to maintain their <hi>Paſſive</hi> Character, even in the Caſe of Uſurpation, and Introducing a new Form, contrary to the Fundamental Conſtitution, they are bound to ſit ſtill, and never to Aſſiſt to Reſtore their <hi>Rightful</hi> Prince, or ancient Form of Government, but ſhould truſt Providence, or rather tempt it to forſake them, to their utter deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But they who would be led by the Authority of theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our preſent Settlement, I hope will learn even from thence to ſubmit to it, and attempt nothing againſt it; and then I doubt not but there are brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men enough to defend it from all Foreign Force.</p>
